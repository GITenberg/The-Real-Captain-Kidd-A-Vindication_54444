<p>It is to be feared that honest and well-meaning
men have not infrequently incurred
the odium of posterity, not so much
by reason of any enormities of which they
have themselves been guilty, as because it
has been their misfortune to be set to impossible
tasks by employers or comrades, to
whom they have been only too faithful.
Few, if any, of such men have less deserved
their fate than Captain Kidd, one of the
unluckiest men that ever lived, who left this
world on Friday the 23d of May, 1701,
after woeful experiences at sea of the doings
of an unruly crew, and on shore of the
schemings of unscrupulous politicians and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
lawyers at Boston, Newgate, the Old Bailey,
and the Execution Dock at Wapping.</p>

<p>To most of those who woo her, reputation
is a coy and fickle mistress. But she occasionally
evinces a very embarrassing attachment
to men and women, whose innate modesty
and reticence have prompted them
throughout their careers to give her as wide
a berth as possible. She has clung most
unfairly and pertinaciously for more than
two centuries to poor Kidd, who in common
with most men of his calling, had no desire
whatever to obtrude himself on the public
notice. This worthy, honest hearted, steadfast,
much enduring sailor, a typical sea
captain of his day, seems really to have done
his best to serve his country and his employers
according to his lights, in very difficult
circumstances. His fatal mistake which
brought all his sufferings on him was that he
yielded to the solicitations, if not to the intimidations,
of personages of higher rank
than his own, who for their own ends induced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
him against his better judgment to
embark on an impossible enterprise, which
after the manner of his kind he doggedly
tried to carry through to the utmost of his
ability, and in which he came nearer attaining
success than could reasonably have been
anticipated. For his pains, after giving
himself into custody in reliance on the word
and honour of his chief employer, a Whig
nobleman, he was ignominiously executed
and hung in chains, after nearly two years’
close incarceration, and has ever since been
held up to execration as the arch pirate, who
left behind him untold hoards of treasure
taken from the murdered crews of peaceable
merchantmen, and buried God knows where,
on the innumerable coasts and keys of the
West Indies, where they are popularly supposed
to await discovery to this day. It
would be difficult to conceive any wilder
misrepresentation of the poor man’s doings.</p>

<p>Kidd seems to have been born in Scotland
and to have spent the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
his life in the American Colonies, neither of
which circumstances was likely to stand him
in good stead, either with the great men who
employed him or with the London juries, by
whom he was found guilty of murder and
piracy. It is not alleged by his detractors
that he had not borne an excellent character,
until he was sent on his wild-goose chase
after pirates, nor is there any reason to believe
that he had any taste himself for
piracy. On the contrary, it was his exemplary
past conduct in this respect, in which
he was certainly in advance of his time,
which was the primary cause of his ruin, inasmuch
as it induced the Earl of Bellamont,
the Governor of New England, at the instigation
of a local magnate, Colonel Livingstone,
to select him as the most fitting
instrument for the furtherance of the King’s
alleged designs for the suppression of
piracy, when at the mature age of fifty-two,
he was living a reputable sea-faring life in
easy circumstances, possessed of a ship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
his own, and married to a wife with a considerable
fortune, settled in New York.</p>

<p>Bellamont was appointed Governor of
New York by His Majesty King William
the Third, early in the year 1695. Two
years before he had been treasurer and receiver
general of the late Queen Mary; but
she had found it impossible to allow him to
retain that post. In her diary of 1693 she
writes: “Lord Bellamont behaved himself
impertinently. I turned him out and
was censured for it by all, which was no
small vexation to me. But I could not be
convinced that I was in the wrong, yet was
sorry it was so understood.” That he was
given to taking unjustifiable action on ill-grounded
suspicions would appear from the
fact that in the same year (1693) he had
made himself ridiculous by a vexatious and
abortive impeachment of the Lord Chancellor
of Ireland, Lord Coningsby, and one of
the Irish Lord Justices, Sir Charles Porter,
both of whom he had arraigned for high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
treason and other imaginary crimes and
misdemeanors. The House of Commons, to
whom he had presented his articles of impeachment,
could not stomach proceedings
so obviously calculated to bring it into contempt;
and unanimously decided that the
great majority of his accusations were absolutely
groundless, while they declined to
take any action on the remainder, considering
the state of Ireland at the time when the
alleged breaches of the law had taken place.
It is of course impossible to say with certainty
how far his ineptitude on this occasion,
and the remembrance of the Queen’s
dislike to the man, induced the King to offer
him a colonial governorship. But he would
be a bold man who would venture to deny
that even in more modern times similar
appointments have been offered to and
accepted by men, whom their own party
have found it convenient to rid Parliament
of at any cost, without regard to the interests
of the Colonies to which they have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
relegated. In those days colonial governorships
were less sought after than they are
now; and it was hopeless to expect any man
of mark at home to accept one.</p>

<p>From an “Account of the proceedings in
relation to Captain Kidd in two letters from
a Person of Quality to a kinsman of the
Earl of Bellamont,” published in 1701, the
year of Kidd’s death, with the avowed object
of vindicating the memory of Bellamont,
who was then dead, it appears that
New York had at that time, rightly or
wrongly, earned a bad name in England.
These letters, which so far as they appeared
to whitewash Bellamont and Kidd’s other
employers, were eagerly accepted and embellished
by Macaulay, are historically interesting
from the side lights which they
throw on certain differences which had then
arisen between England and her American
Colonies, and were already paving the way
for the separation of the Mother Country
and her strongest child. Their writer begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
by informing his readers that “it was then
well known that for several years two very
pernicious things had been growing up in
our American Colonies,&mdash;an unlawful
trade in fraud of the Acts of Navigation
and the Plantations, infinitely prejudicial to
England, and the cursed practice of piracy,
utterly destructive of all commerce.”
“Many,” he tells us, “were insensibly
drawn into these ill courses by observing
what excessive wealth the offenders gained
in a short time, and with what impunity
they offended. For some Governors, having
found a way to share in the profit, were
obliged not only to connive at, but protect,
the offenders.” This anonymous gentleman
had often, he says, been told by Bellamont
that His Majesty had done him the honour
to say “that he thought him a man of resolution
and integrity, and with these qualifications,
more likely than any other he could
then think of” (apparently from Bellamont’s
own account of the interview the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
King had not much time to waste in troubling
himself about so unimportant a matter),
“to put a stop to that illegal trade and
to the growth of piracy, for which reason he
had made choice of him as Governor of New
York, and for the same reason intended to
put the government of New England into
his hands.”</p>

<p>It would therefore appear to be admitted
by this gentleman that the primary object
of the King in the selection of Bellamont
was to secure the more rigorous enforcement
of the Navigation and Plantation
Acts. These Acts had been passed in the
reign of Charles the Second, for the purpose
of securing for England the monopoly
of American trade, by preventing under
heavy penalties any direct trade between the
Colonists and their neighbors, French,
Spanish, or Dutch, in the West Indies.
They prohibited the import and export of
goods into or from the plantations except
in ships built in England; and provided for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the seizure and forfeiture of any other vessels
employed in that trade and all goods
found on board. It will readily be understood
that, although this monopoly was regarded
with great favour in England, it had
been growing more and more unpopular
with the Colonists, as their commerce and
population increased, because their traffic
with their neighbors was incommoded and
hampered by it; the inevitable result being
that the smuggling of goods into and out of
the plantations had become a popular and
lucrative and not very difficult business.
Our Dutch King’s desire to check this
smuggling was not unnatural, money being
at that time urgently required by him for
the prosecution of his French War.</p>

<p>Bellamont, appointed Governor of New
England in July, 1695, seems to have been
in no hurry to go out to America. The primary
object of his appointment being the
more rigid enforcement of the Navigation
Acts, it may be that it was thought desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that he should be at hand during the passage
through Parliament in the following
year of the English Statute entitled “An
Act for preventing frauds and regulating
abuses in the Plantation Trade.” The Parliamentary
draftsmen of those days had a
pretty talent for invective exercisable on
the instructions of those in power. In this
case it was displayed not only in the preamble
of the Act, but also in the recitals to several
of the clauses. From these we learn
that notwithstanding the Acts of King
Charles the Second “made for the encouragement
of the navigation of the kingdom
and for the better securing and regulating
the plantation trade, great abuses were
daily committed to the detriment of the
English navigation and the loss of a great
part of the plantation trade, through the
artifice and cunning of ill-disposed persons.”
Amongst these artful, cunning, and
ill-disposed persons, the pre-eminence is assigned
to Scotchmen, who in that year were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in bad odour with the King, and projecting
their unfortunate Darien expedition which,
had it succeeded, might have hit the English
trade far harder than any amount of smuggling
could have done: “Great frauds and
abuses,” we are told by the draftsman,
“have been committed by Scotchmen and
others in the plantation trade, by obtruding
false and counterfeit certificates upon the
government officers of having given security
in this kingdom to bring the ladings of plantation
goods to England, Wales, or the town
of Berwick-upon-Tweed; as also certificates
of having discharged their ladings of
plantation goods in this kingdom pursuant
to securities taken in the plantations, and
also cocquets or certificates of having taken
in their ladings of European goods in England,
Wales, or Berwick-upon-Tweed, by
means whereof they may carry the goods of
Scotland and other places of Europe, without
shipping the same in England, Wales,
or Berwick-upon-Tweed to His Majesty’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
plantations, and also carry the goods of the
plantations directly to Scotland or any other
market in Europe without bringing the
same to England, Wales, or Berwick-upon-Tweed.”
To remedy these malpractices, a
penalty of five hundred pounds was imposed
by the Act on any person making use of
such false cocquets and certificates. Every
Colonial Governor was required to take a
solemn oath to do his utmost, that all the
clauses, matters, and things contained in the
Navigation Acts should be punctually and
<i lang="la">bonâ fide</i> observed; and on proof that any
Governor had neglected to take this oath, or
been wittingly or willingly negligent in doing
his duty, he was to be removed from his
government and fined one thousand pounds
sterling. All naval officers in the plantations
were required to give security to the
Commissioners of Customs for the faithful
performance of their duties, and until such
securities had been given and approved by
the Commissioners, the Governor was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
answerable for their defaults. The Act is
very lengthy and verbose. But the above
are its most important provisions.</p>

<p>Legislation of this sort was thoroughly
in harmony with the policy pursued at that
time by the Home Government in its dealings
with the Colonies. Generations had
yet to pass before any doubt as to its wisdom
began to dawn in the minds of Englishmen.
Had Bellamont’s instructions from
his royal patron been confined to its furtherance,
it would have been well for poor
Kidd, and the reputations of Bellamont and
sundry great personages in England. But
they had, as has been seen, extended to the
suppression of the alleged growth of piracy
in New England. As a matter of fact, it
may well be doubted whether piracy had,
as alleged, been for several years on the increase
in that part of the world. In the
West Indies it had greatly diminished.
Less than thirty years before, the buccaneers
had been so numerous that, on receiving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
directions of King Charles the Second to
stop their depredations on the Spaniards,
they had in defiance of his orders stormed
the Castle of Chagres; and marching thence
across the Isthmus, more than a thousand
strong, sacked and burnt Panama itself in
the face of the organized forces of the Spaniards.
Now the great Brotherhood of the
Coast had practically ceased to exist. Such
piracy as still lingered on amongst the English
speaking race was for the most part
limited to the eastern seas and consisted
mainly in depredations on the shipping of
Mussulmans, Armenians, and the natives of
India, collectively termed by seamen Moors.
Without in any way extenuating the practice
of plundering these people, it is only
right that we should bear in mind, in considering
the case of Kidd and his crew, the
belief then widely prevalent amongst Europeans
that there was little if any impropriety
or disgrace attaching to the ill-treatment and
robbery of black men by white. Witness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
for example, the slave trade, and the conditions
under which negroes were worked in
the plantations. Moorish piracy still prevailed
in the Mediterranean, attended by
great cruelty to Europeans; and retaliation
on the so-called Moors in the eastern seas
must have seemed to the man in the street
the most natural thing in the world. Darby
Mullins, who was hung with Kidd, was no
doubt voicing the opinion commonly held
by seamen and others, not only in the plantations
but in London and Bristol, when
whilst expressing in his last moments to the
Ordinary of Newgate his sincere contrition
for his habits of swearing and cursing and
profaning the Sabbath day, and his neglect
to return thanks to his Creator for his preservation
in an earthquake at Jamaica (sins
of commission and omission which he regarded
as really serious offences and for
which he asked pardon), nevertheless protested
in defence of his piracy under Culliford
that “he had not known but that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was very lawful” (as he said he had been
told) “to plunder ships and goods belonging
to the enemies of Christianity.” We
may indeed be permitted to doubt, whether
King William himself would have pressed
Bellamont to check this piracy in the eastern
seas, had it not been for two considerations:
the one a possible apprehension that it
might extend to the plundering of Dutch
merchantmen sailing to and from his Dutch
Colonies in the East, and the other the increasing
complaints on the part of the
wealthy East India Company who exercised
great influence in Parliament, that it
injured their trade and led to complications
in their dealings with the Great Mogul.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the suppression of
piracy in the East was not only a desirable
object, but one that was likely to commend
itself to the mercantile community; and any
plausible project for its furtherance that
would not necessitate his immediate departure
from England would naturally be welcomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
by Bellamont. Such a project was
not long in presenting itself.</p>

<p>To return to his defence written by the
anonymous Person of Quality: “As soon,”
he says, “as it was known that the Earl of
Bellamont was designed for Governor, all
persons who had concerns in New York
made their applications to him. Amongst
others, Colonel Robert Livingstone, who
had several employments in that province,
had frequent access to him, as well upon the
account of the public affairs there, as of several
matters which he had depending before
the council and the treasury. The Earl,
taking occasion to mention to this gentleman
the scandal which lay upon New York
in respect of the encouragement and retreat,
which the pirates found there, Colonel Livingstone
confessed” (as might be expected
of a canny Scot, who wished to ingratiate
himself with the great man) “that there
was too much ground for the complaint,
and that if some speedy and effectual course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
were not taken to suppress those enormities,
so many persons would be drawn into the
guilt that it would be exceedingly difficult
to master them.”</p>

<p>After thinking the matter over, he saw
his way to make himself serviceable.
“When he came again to wait on the Earl,
he took notice of the zeal the Earl had expressed
at their last conversation for putting
a stop to that piratical trade, since
which time, he said, he had spoke with one
Captain William Kidd, lately come” to
London “from New York in a sloop of his
own, who told him that he knew most of the
principal men who had been abroad roving
and others who had lately gone out, and
likewise had some knowledge of the places
where they usually made their rendezvous,
and that he would undertake to seize most
of them in case he might be employed in one
of the King’s ships, a good sailer of about
thirty guns, and might have one hundred
and fifty men. He said that though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
pirates were many in number yet they
had at that time no ship of considerable
size. Livingstone affirmed that Kidd was
a bold and honest man and he believed better
than any other to be employed on that
occasion.”</p>

<p>In the light of subsequent events it is
much to be regretted that poor Kidd happened
at that juncture to have come to London
from New York and, whether in his
cups or otherwise, made these disclosures
to Livingstone. But that Livingstone was
fully justified in his estimate of Kidd’s character
is clear from the evidence of the four
most reputable witnesses (it may almost be
said the only reputable witnesses) at Kidd’s
subsequent trials,&mdash;Colonel Hewson, Captain
Bond, Captain Humphreys, and Mr.
Thomas Cooper,&mdash;who happened to be in
London, when the trial came on. Colonel
Hewson then testified that Kidd was a
mighty man in the French war in the West
Indies; and had served under his (Hewson’s)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
command, being sent to him by the
order of Colonel Codrington. “He was
with me,” he swore, “in two engagements
against the French, and fought as well as
any man I ever saw, according to the
proportion of his men. We had six
Frenchmen to deal with, and only mine and
his ship.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “Do you think I was a pirate?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hewson.</span> “I know his men would have
gone a-pirateering and he refused it; and
his men seized upon his ship. When he
went this voyage, he consulted me and told
me they had engaged him on such an expedition.
And I told him he had enough already,
and might be contented with what
he had. And he said that was his own inclination;
but my Lord Bellamont had told
him, if he did not go this voyage, that there
were great men and they would stop his
brigantine in the river, if he did not go.”</p>

<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Turton</span>. “Who told you
so? Did he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hewson.</span> “Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Turton</span>. “Did you apprehend
that his intention in that undertaking
was to be a pirate?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hewson.</span> “No, my lord. He told me
his business was to go cruising and surprise
pirates.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Solicitor General</span>. “Did he tell
you he had no such design?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hewson.</span> “Yes; he said he would be
shot to death before he would do any such
thing. He was very serviceable in the West
Indies.”</p>

<p>On the same occasion Captain Bond
swore that he knew that Kidd was very useful
at the beginning of the war, and Captain
Humphreys that he had known Kidd at
the beginning of the late war, and that he
had the applause of the General, as he could
show by the General’s letter, a general applause
of what he had done from time to
time.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Cooper gave evidence to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
like effect. Being asked by Kidd to tell the
Lord Chief Baron Ward, what he knew of
him in the West Indies, he replied: “I
was on board the <i>Lyon</i>; and this Captain
Kidd brought his ship from a place that belonged
to the Dutch and brought her into
the King’s service at the beginning of the
war, about ten years ago; and we fought
Monsieur Du Cass a whole day, and I thank
God we got the better of it. And Captain
Kidd behaved himself very well in the face
of his enemies.”</p>

<p>Two points should be noted in Colonel
Hewson’s evidence. First, that he knew
that Kidd, years before there was any
thought of sending him out to suppress
piracy in the eastern seas, had not only done
good service for England in the war against
France, but had also refused to join his crew
in “pirateering,” with the result that they
had seized his ship. Secondly, that Kidd
had told him before he started on his last unlucky
expedition, that he was drawn into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the business by an intimation on the part of
Bellamont, that there were great men in it,
and by the threat that if he did not go, his
brigantine would be stopped in the river.
That there were great men in the business,
far greater men than Bellamont, is indisputable.
That great men in those days
were wont to use their great power more
arbitrarily than they dare to do now-a-days
is also indisputable. That Kidd was more
or less coerced into embarking in their business
by the fear that they might stop his
brigantine in the river if he refused to go,
cannot, in view of the statement which he
made to Colonel Hewson before starting, be
reasonably regarded as improbable.</p>

<p>To return to the narrative of the Person
of Quality, who was not likely to lay stress
on these points. “His Majesty,” he says,
“was made acquainted with the proposal by
the Earl of Bellamont, and was pleased to
consult the Admiralty. But the war employing
all the King’s ships which were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
a condition of service, and the great want of
seamen (notwithstanding the press and all
other means used), together with the remoteness
of the voyage, and the uncertainty
of meeting the pirates or taking them if
they were found, occasioned after some deliberation
the laying aside of the project as
impracticable at that time.” In other
words, the Admiralty officials, realizing the
difficulty of the task, declined to take any
part in it, and pleaded inability.</p>

<p>The pertinacious Livingstone, as might
have been expected, was not to be staved
off in this fashion; and before long he hit
upon a new project. “He did propose to
the Earl, that if persons of consideration
might be induced to join in the expense of
buying and fitting out a proper ship, he had
such an opinion of Kidd’s capacity and good
meaning, and so great a desire that some
stop might be put to these practices that
he would be one of the undertakers” (incurring
little risk so long as he stood in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
persons of sufficient consideration); “and
that he and Kidd would be at one-fifth part
of the charge. The Earl thought himself
obliged in duty to make this second overture
known to His Majesty, who was
pleased to approve highly of the design, because”
(note the reason) “nothing of that
nature was to be effected in any other way.
He did also declare, as an encouragement
to such an undertaking, that the persons
with whom the Earl should engage to be at
the expense of the voyage should have a
grant of what Kidd should take from the
pirates, so far as it might belong to him,
except some part, which he would reserve
for himself chiefly to show that he was a
partner in the undertaking.”</p>

<p>So far, therefore, as appears from the
narrative of this Person of Quality, who is
the only witness of these confidential communications,
whose evidence is now available.
The original suggestion of Kidd, who
unlike the majority of his fellow Colonists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was opposed to piracy in the East or elsewhere,
was that if he was sent out on board
of a King’s ship, with officers and men of
the King’s navy, he would indicate to them
the places to which the pirates were wont to
resort, and thus enable the King’s sailors to
seize them. The Admiralty doubted the
feasibility of this plan, even if they had had
the necessary means at the moment to carry
it out. The disastrous suggestion that
Kidd should be sent out in command of a
ship, provided at the expense of persons of
consideration, and manned by a scratch
crew of undisciplined men, emanated from
Livingstone, and was assented to by the
King as a <i lang="fr">pis-aller</i>. At the worst the King
could not lose a farthing by it. If it succeeded,
he would not only gain his object,
but pocket a substantial share of the plunder.
The adventurers might pocket more,
but they would run some risk of parting
with their money and getting no return for
it. What would happen to Kidd, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
failed, appears to have been no concern to
any of them.</p>

<p>The King’s approval of the adventure
having been obtained, the next thing to be
done was to find the necessary persons of
consideration, willing to put their money in
it. Six thousand pounds only were required,
of which Livingstone and Kidd each
contributed six hundred. The remainder
was at once advanced by four of the most
powerful men in England at that time,
leading men in the King’s Whig Ministry,
Somers the Lord Chancellor; the Earl of
Orford, the First Lord of the Admiralty;
and the two Secretaries of State, the Earl
of Romney and the Duke of Shrewsbury.
Great men indeed were now in the business,
and it was too late for Kidd to back out of
it. So far Livingstone had succeeded, probably
beyond his wildest hopes.</p>

<p>But although these great men were quite
willing to risk their moneys in this adventure,
they were by no means keen that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
names should appear in connection with it.
In the grant<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> made to the adventurers by
the King of the pirates’ goods and wares
to be taken by Kidd, it was expressly stated
that his ship, the <i>Adventure Galley</i>, had
been, with the King’s knowledge and royal
encouragement, fitted out to sea at the great
and sole charge of the Earl of Bellamont
and Sir Edmund Harrison, and four obscure
personages, Samuel Newton, John
Rowley, George Watson, and Thomas Reynolds,
not one of whom had advanced a
penny of their own upon it; and it was to
these persons, and not to Livingstone, Kidd,
or the four King’s ministers that the grant
purported to be made on the ground that
the King was “graciously inclined that so
chargeable an undertaking tending to such
good and laudable ends should have meet
and proper encouragement.” As a <i lang="la">quid
pro quo</i> for this highly improper grant, the
legality of which was afterwards very seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
called in question in Parliament, the
grantees by an indenture of even date
therewith agreed to well and truly account
for and deliver to the use of His Majesty
one full clear tenth part of any vessels,
merchandise, moneys, goods, and wares that
might be captured by Kidd.</p>

<p>Two Commissions were granted to Kidd
himself, the one, letters of marque in ordinary
form, empowering him to capture
French ships, and the other, a special Commission
authorizing him to apprehend, seize,
and take four persons designated by name
as pirates, Thomas Too, John Ireland,
Thomas Wake, and William Maze <i lang="la">alias</i>
Mace (none of whom were found by him in
the course of his wanderings), and also any
other pirates, freebooters, and sea rovers,
whom he might be fortunate enough to
catch, together with their ships, merchandise,
goods, and wares. How he was to satisfy
himself that any persons whom he
might come across were pirates, unless he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
caught them in the act of piracy, and what
the consequences to himself would be, if he
had the misfortune by mistake to kill persons
whom he suspected to be pirates, but
of whose piracy he had no legal proof, or
if by any equally likely mischance he neglected
to seize persons who were pirates,
but whom he could not prove to be such,
does not appear from any of the verbose
legal documents drawn up on this occasion.
What is clear from them<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> amongst other
things is this, that they imposed on his men
conditions which were likely to be and
in the event proved to be very unpalatable
to them. The most important of these was
that if they took no prizes, the crew were to
have no pay. Another condition was that
if the prize moneys were insufficient to meet
the full amount advanced by the four great
men, the deficiency was to be made good by
Kidd and Livingstone, both of whom were
substantial men. In the event of the prize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
moneys amounting to one hundred thousand
pounds, the <i>Adventure Galley</i>, which
turned out to be a leaky old vessel, was to
become the property of Kidd. The great
men therefore ran very little pecuniary risk,
and obviously hoped to make enormous
gains from the enterprise. But for this expectation
it is highly improbable that any
of them would have embarked in the adventure.</p>

<p>It is, of course, very difficult at this distance
of time to determine with any certainty
what amount of blame attaches to
the several personages concerned in this
unfortunate business. Very grave suspicion
attaches to some of them. One thing,
however, is reasonably certain, that no candid
person who will now take the trouble to
look into the case carefully, can come to any
other conclusion than that the balance of evidence
is distinctly in favour of poor Kidd;
and that he was fully justified in the reply
which he made to Lord Chief Baron Ward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
when called upon to say why sentence of
death should not be pronounced upon him.
“My lord, it is a very hard sentence. For
my part, I am the innocentest person of
them all.”</p>

<p>Legal preliminaries completed, Kidd’s
ship, the <i>Adventure Galley</i>, was
launched in Castle’s Yard at Deptford, on
the fourth of December, 1695, and set sail
between two and three months afterwards.
Sir Edmund Harrison, described by Bellamont’s
apologist as “a reputable city merchant,”
had been at the pains to select the
crew with great care so as to exclude all
Scotch and Colonials, who were regarded as
ineligible by reason of their supposed proclivities
to smuggling and piracy. “That
nothing might be wanting,” we are told by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the same writer, “which the nature of the
thing would admit notwithstanding the
great difficulty of finding men at that time,
Sir Edmund Harrison took such care of the
crew that every officer in the ship and almost
all the seamen had settled families in
England.” “True it is,” he adds in the
next paragraph, “that this care was in a
great degree rendered ineffectual: for most
of the crew were pressed before Kidd got
out of the river.” Kidd himself in his artless
narrative tells the tale more tersely,
merely recording the fact that “on the first
of March, when he came to the Buoy at the
Nore, his men were pressed for the fleet.”
Seeing that the First Lord of the Admiralty
was one of the principal partners in the adventure,
it may seem strange to those who
have had no personal experience of official
blunderings, that precautions had not been
taken to prevent this untoward mishap,
which made a hopeless enterprise more
hopeless than ever. For it left Kidd no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
alternative but to get the bulk of his crew
from America. With such of his men as
had not been deemed worth taking by the
press gang, he managed to get away from
Plymouth about the end of April. On his
way to America, he captured a small French
vessel with salt and fishing tackle bound for
Newfoundland, and brought her into port
at New York. There in the head centre
and hotbed of the smuggling and piracy,
which the King desired to repress, he set to
work to pick up the best substitutes he could
find for the men who had been so carefully
selected for him and so unceremoniously
taken from him at the Nore.</p>

<p>He reached New York in July and did
not leave it till September. In the interval
the French ship which he had captured was
condemned by the authorities as a lawful
prize; and according to Kidd’s narrative of
these events, “the produce thereof purchased
provisions for the <i>Adventure Galley</i>
for her further intended voyage.” It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
must have been anything but an easy job to
get the requisite number of men to fill up
the vacancies in his ship’s company. The
Colony was not over populated, nor was
there any lack of work for those who cared
to take it. The only terms he was authorized
to offer, “No purchase, no pay,” were
not likely to be accepted by skilled and experienced
seamen, who had the chance of
earning a good living at home by smuggling,
or of going out and making their fortunes,
as some had lately done in the East
under such captains as those whom it was
now Kidd’s business to catch. Nor was the
catching of their old friends for hanging purposes
likely to be a popular employment in
that part of the world. He probably picked
up some adventurous boys, eager to go to
sea at any cost, in ignorance of the fate to
which they were consigning themselves. Of
the older men who joined, Darby Mullins,
a rolling stone who had gathered no moss,
may perhaps be taken as a fair sample.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
From so much of his previous history as
this poor man told to the chaplain at Newgate,
it appears that he was an Irishman,
born near Londonderry, kidnapped when
young and shipped for the plantations,
where he had followed various honest avocations
without any conspicuous success.
Most of Kidd’s grown-up recruits, it is to
be feared, were men of this kind, who for
one reason or another were indisposed to
remain long in any one employment, and
likely to abandon the enterprise as soon as
they got tired of it. Whilst picking up one
and another of these men during his last
stay at his home in New York, Kidd, one
would think, must often have regretted that
he had embarked on this miserable business.
But he seems to have been upheld not
only then but till the day of his death by a
childlike belief in the great men whose service
he had entered, a belief which was possibly
shared by his wife. Money was not a
matter of great importance to either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
them. It is not unlikely that she was
pleased to hear about her husband’s great
friends, his interviews with them in London,
and what they were likely to do for him
and her when he had successfully completed
his task. It is possible that she may have
looked forward with some complacency,
poor soul, to the prospect of herself associating
with the women folk of these great
people. Perhaps she even dreamed of becoming
a great lady herself. Why not?
What more likely than that her husband
would be knighted by the King for his services
and that she would become Lady
Kidd?</p>

<p>Starting from New York in September
in command of his undisciplined and unpromising
crew, Kidd proceeded first to the
Madeiras, in company with one Joyner,
master of a brigantine belonging to the Bermudas.
He arrived at his destination on
the eighth of October. Thence they sailed
together to Bonavista, where they stayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
for some days and took in salt; thence to
St. Jago where they watered; and thence to
the Cape of Good Hope. On the twelfth of
December, “in the latitude of thirty-two,”
to quote from Kidd’s narrative, “they met
with five English men-of-war. Captain
Warren was commodore; and sailed a week
in their company, and then parted and sailed
to Telere, a port in the Island of Madagascar.”
Here Kidd failed to find at their
usual rendezvous any of the pirates after
whom he had come, and concluding that
they were preying on the Eastern trade,
continued his course eastwards in pursuit of
them. In company with a sloop belonging
to Barbadoes, which had come in at Telere
whilst he was there, he sailed to the Island of
Johanna on the coast of Malabar. There
he “found four East India merchantmen
outward bound and watered there all together
and stayed about five days. From
thence about the twenty-second of March he
sailed for Mehila, an island ten leagues distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
from Johanna, where he arrived the
next morning and careened the <i>Galley</i>.”
“And about fifty men died there in about
a week’s time,” he tells us pithily and without
comment, as though such a catastrophe
was an ordinary occurrence, as indeed it
probably was in those days to a ship’s crew
suddenly attacked by cholera or plague in
those parts. These deaths seem to have
induced him to leave that coast somewhat
suddenly and to seek healthier quarters.
After cruising awhile in the open sea, the
only known specific in those days for such
mischances, he came to the entrance of the
Red Sea; obviously a likely place to find
the pirates in, since it was specifically named
in the Articles of Agreement between Bellamont,
Livingstone, and himself as the place
in which the pirates of whom he was in search
intended to commit their depredations, and
the date of the sailing of the Mecca fleet was
approaching. He had now been the greater
part of a year at sea without taking a prize,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and had lost more than a third of his crew
by sickness. His ship had grown crazy and
leaky; and neither he nor his men had yet
earned a penny. No wonder that his ship’s
company was growing discontented. The
wonder is that Kidd had thus far been able
to keep them fairly in hand, which it is admitted
he had done.</p>

<p>On reaching the Red Sea, he waited for
three weeks at Bab’s Key, a small island at
its entrance, a convenient station for observing
all ships going into or out of that
sea. It was alleged at his trial by Palmer,
one of the two men who became King’s evidence,
that he said on one occasion to his
men, whilst waiting here, “Come, boys, I
will make money enough out of that fleet.”
Little credence is to be attached to Palmer’s
evidence, as will be seen hereafter. But assuming
that Kidd made use of these words,
they are susceptible of a perfectly innocent
interpretation. Kidd was on the lookout
not only for pirates but also for French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ships. It was not improbable that some of
the vessels in the Mecca fleet would be ships
belonging to Frenchmen, or sailing under
French colours to the French factories in
India, in which case he would have had a
perfect right to seize them under his letters
of marque. It was also by no means improbable
that he might catch some of the
Madagascar pirates in pursuit of, or possibly
in possession of, the fleet or some part
of it, in which case it would clearly have
been his bounden duty under his commission
to seize the pirates and the ships which they
had captured. In either of these events he
would, to use the words attributed to him
by Palmer, have made money enough out of
the fleet.</p>

<p>There is some conflict of evidence as to
what actually happened on the fourteenth of
August, when the fleet came by. One thing
is certain, that either before or after Kidd
came among them, they flew English and
Dutch colours, and that a fire was opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
on Kidd from one or both of their convoys.
It also appears that “sundry shots were
fired from Kidd’s ship,” possibly with the
object of bringing the ships to, in order that
explanations might be forthcoming from
both sides. On this point an attempt made
on the part of the prosecution by both their
witnesses to mislead the jury was frustrated
by Kidd. Palmer had led them to
believe that Kidd was the aggressor. “I
ask this one thing,” said Kidd. “Did the
Mecca fleet fire first at me or I at them?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmer.</span> “No; they fired first.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “And just now, the other” (that
is, Bradenham) “said I fired first. Is he
not perjured?”</p>

<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Turton</span>. “Mr. Bradenham,
did he fire first or no?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradenham.</span> “He fired at them. I
only said, you fired at them. I did not say
first or last.”</p>

<p>No harm was done by the shots on either
side; and the fleet went by without any interchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of explanations. It was no fault
of Kidd’s that its convoys mistook him for
a pirate, of which there were undoubtedly
plenty in those parts. But the failure of
his plan to make money out of it cannot
have added to his prestige with his crew.</p>

<p>Leaving Bab’s Key, the <i>Adventure Galley</i>
stood back across the Arabian Sea and
cruised again along the coast of Malabar,
the only coast on which there is the slightest
suggestion that Kidd ever committed any
act of piracy. In considering his doings and
those of his men here, and the construction
placed on them first by the East India Company,
and afterwards by the prosecution at
his trial, several things must be borne in
mind. At that time there were in India not
only English, but Portuguese and French
factories. Little love was lost between
them, and there was open war between England
and France. English and American
pirates had been for some time past preying
on the coast trade, and the <i>Adventure Galley</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
might very reasonably be mistaken for a
pirate by any ship which she chased. The
coast trade was carried on mainly in vessels
manned by Asiatics with, in some cases,
two or three Europeans on board. The wily
Indian had by this time learned the advantage
of carrying Europeans of more than
one nationality in each ship, so that if
caught by a ship carrying French colours,
he might produce a Frenchman as the
owner, and if caught by an English ship an
Englishman. It was Kidd’s plain duty to
take as prizes any French vessels he came
across, and with that end in view to examine
carefully every ship which he had reason to
suspect was French. He knew very little of
the coast or of the Eastern languages, and
stood greatly in need of a pilot and an interpreter,
or, as he was then termed by seamen,
a “linguister.” His crew were becoming
unruly, and whenever he left his ship to
examine personally any suspected prize, he
ran the risk of their putting to sea and leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
him in the lurch. The first vessel he was
accused at his trial of having plundered was
a small one, of little value, manned by Armenians,
with two Europeans on board,
an Englishman and a Portuguese. He engaged
the Englishman as a pilot and the
Portuguese as a “linguister.” There is no
reason to doubt that both these men were
thankful to get on board a European ship
again and to join his ship’s company, as
others in similar circumstances admittedly
did afterwards.</p>

<p>The ship itself with its Armenian crew he
allowed to proceed on its course after a few
days’ detention. Before it left him, some
misunderstanding seems unfortunately to
have arisen between the English seamen on
board of her and the Armenians; and it is
alleged that on this occasion the former
hung up four of the latter and spanked
them with the flats of their cutlasses.
Kidd’s defence, and there is no reason to
doubt that it was a perfectly genuine defence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
so far as he was concerned, was that
he had nothing whatever to do with this
fracas and that he did not go on board the
ship at all. It was further alleged by the
King’s evidence that his men took out of
her a bale of coffee and a bale of pepper
and some beeswax. Whether they neglected
to give adequate money or goods in
exchange is not stated, but as it is admitted
that Kidd trafficked with many of the ships
which he met on this coast, it is not unreasonable
to suppose that he did so with this
one. At any rate, there is no good reason
to believe that he was a party to the theft
of these paltry articles.</p>

<p>The next vessel he met was a Portuguese
man-of-war which attacked him without the
slightest provocation, taking him possibly
for one of the pirates of whom he was in
quest, or possibly for some less reputable
reason. Here again, Palmer, the King’s
evidence, tried to give the jury the false impression
that Kidd was the aggressor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmer.</span> “He met a Portuguese ship
and fought her.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “Who fired first?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmer.</span> “The Portuguese fired first.”</p>

<p>Kidd’s narrative written before he was
taken into custody, or had any reason to
believe that he would be called to account
for this incident, goes more fully into this
matter. Though from other parts of his narrative
he seems to have been a man of few
words, he waxes eloquent on this occasion.
It appears that he had been into Carrawarr
a few days before, to water. “There
the gentlemen of the English factory,” he
says, “gave the narrator an account that
the Portuguese were fitting out two men-of-war
to take him, and advised him to put
to sea, and to take care of himself from
them, and immediately to set sail thereupon.
And the next morning about break of day
he saw the said two men-of-war standing
for the said <i>Galley</i>, and they spoke with
him, and asked him whence he was. Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
replied, from London, and they returned
answer, from Goa; and so parted, wishing
each other a good voyage. And still sailing
along the coast, the Commodore of the
said man-of-war kept dogging the said
<i>Galley</i> all the night, waiting an opportunity
to board her; and in the morning without
speaking a word, fired six great guns at
the <i>Galley</i>, some whereof went through her
and wounded four of his men. And thereupon
he fired upon him again, and the fight
continued all day; and the Narrator had
eleven men wounded. The other Portuguese
man-of-war lay some distance off and
could not come up with the <i>Galley</i>, being
calm; else would likewise have assaulted the
same. The said fight was sharp, and the
said Portuguese left the said <i>Galley</i> with
such satisfaction, that the narrator believes
no Portuguese will ever attack the King’s
colours again in that part of the world especially.”
In reading this narrative, it should
be remembered that Kidd was no braggadocio;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
but a plain sea captain who had admittedly
greatly distinguished himself in the
war, which was still in progress against the
French.</p>

<p>The next enormity with which he was
charged at his trial was cruelty to the natives.
It appears that he had sent some of
his men ashore at one of the Malabar
Islands for wood and water; and the natives
having cut one of their throats, he
caused one native to be shot by way of reprisal.
The manner in which capital was
attempted to be made by the prosecution
out of this incident appears plainly from the
verbatim report of the King’s evidence. In
reply to a question by the counsel for the
prosecution, as to what Kidd had done after
fighting with the Portuguese man-of-war,
Bradenham replied, “We went to one of
the Malabar islands for wood and water,
and Captain Kidd went ashore and several
of his men, and plundered several boats
and burnt several huts, and ordered one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of the natives to be tied to a tree and
one of his men to shoot him.” Hoping
apparently to bring some further atrocities
to light, counsel proceeded to ask,
“What was the reason for his shooting this
Indian?”</p>

<p>The answer he got from Bradenham, his
own witness, was, “One of his men that was
his cooper had been ashore, and some of the
natives had cut his throat, and that was the
reason he ordered his men to serve this man
so.” Needless to say, counsel pursued the
subject no further.</p>

<p>Whatever his men’s inclinations may have
been at this time, the next untoward incident
recorded of his doings on this coast
conclusively shows that it was Kidd’s firm
determination that his men should not be
guilty of piracy. He came across a Dutch
ship, <i>The Loyal Captain</i>, under the command
of Captain Hoar. The greater part
of his crew were undoubtedly in favor of
seizing this ship, and it is indisputable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Kidd prevented them from attempting it.
Kidd’s own account at his trial, was as
follows:</p>

<p>“My lord, I will tell you what the case
was. I was coming up within a league of
this Dutchman, and some of my men were
making a mutiny about taking her, and my
gunner” (Moore) “told the people he could
put the captain in a way to take the ship
and be safe. Says I, ‘How will you do
that?’ The gunner answers, ‘We will get
the captain and men aboard.’ ‘And what
then?’ ‘We will go aboard the ship and
plunder her, and we could have it under
their hands that we did not take her.’ Says
I, ‘That is Judas-like. I dare not do such
a thing.’ Says he, ‘We may do it; we are
beggars already.’ ‘Why,’ says I, ‘may we
take this ship because we are poor?’ Upon
that a mutiny arose.”</p>

<p>Palmer, the King’s evidence, admitted
that on this occasion there were nine men
with muskets who were for taking the ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and that Kidd was against their doing so.
The same incident was thus described at the
trial by Parrott, one of the youngsters of the
crew, a Plymouth boy of nineteen years of
age at the date of the trial.</p>

<p>“I shall tell you how it happened according
to the best of my knowledge. The commander
fortuned to come up with this
Captain Hoar’s ship, and some were for
taking her, and some not. And afterwards
there was a little sort of a mutiny and some
were in arms, the greater part. And they
said they would take the ship. And the
commander was not for it; and so they
resolved to go away in a boat and take her.
Captain Kidd said: ‘If you desert my ship,
you shall never come aboard again, and I
will force you into Bombay, and I will carry
you before some of the council there.’ Insomuch
that my commander stilled them,
and they remained on board.”</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that although for
the nonce the mutiny was quelled, it left bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
blood behind between Kidd and Moore, the
spokesman of the mutineers. About a fortnight
afterwards another altercation arose
between them, which ended in Kidd’s knocking
Moore down with a bucket. According
to Parrott, it arose in this way: “Moore
said, ‘Captain, I could have put you in the
way to have taken the ship, and have never
been the worse for it.’ He says, ‘Would
you have me take this ship? I cannot answer
it. They are our friends!’ And my
commander was in a passion, and with that
I went off the deck. I understand that
afterwards the blow was given, but how I
cannot tell.”</p>

<p>From the evidence given by the cook and
a seaman named Barlicorn, who remained
on deck, it appears that Moore upbraided
Kidd and said, “You have brought us to
ruin, and we are desolate;” and that Kidd
said, “Have I brought you to ruin? I
have not done an ill thing to ruin you. You
are a saucy fellow to say those words.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
And then he took up the bucket and gave
him a blow with it.</p>

<p>The version given by Palmer, the King’s
evidence, was this: “Captain Kidd came
and walked upon the deck, and walks by this
Moore. And when he came to him he says,
‘Which way could you have put me in a
way to take this ship and been clear?’ ‘Sir,’
says Moore, ‘I never spoke such a word nor
ever thought such a thing.’ Upon which
Captain Kidd called him ‘a lousie dog.’
And says William Moore, ‘If I am a lousie
dog, you have made me so. You have
brought me to ruin and many more.’ Upon
his saying this, says Captain Kidd, ‘Have
I ruined you, you dog?’ and took the bucket
and struck him on the right side of his head,
of which he died the next day. Repeating
the words two or three times, he took a turn
or two on the deck and then struck him.”</p>

<p>Kidd admitted at the trial that he had
given the blow; but pleaded that he had all
the provocation in the world given him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
that he had no design to kill Moore and no
malice or spleen against him. It was not
done designedly but in his passion, for which
he was heartily sorry.</p>

<p>It is not certain that Moore died of the
blow, for one witness deposed that Bradenham,
the surgeon, who subsequently deserted
Kidd at Madagascar to join the
pirate Culliford, said at the time, “This
blow was not the cause of his death,” and
that Moore had been on the sick list for some
time before. It is only fair to say, however,
that Bradenham denied this.</p>

<p>Whether or not Moore died from the
blow, it is clear that he was the spokesman
of the mutineers on the two occasions on
which dispute arose between Kidd and his
crew as to the plundering of the Dutch ship,
that he upbraided Kidd for his not allowing
his men to commit a gross act of piracy, and
that his death had the effect of quieting the
mutineers for a while.</p>

<p>Coming next to the two cases in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Kidd did take prizes in the course of this
voyage, according to his own illiterate but
intelligible narrative, he met in November,
1697, “A Moore’s ship of about 200 tons,
coming from Surratt, bound for the coast
of Malabar, loaded with two horses, sugar,
and cotton in trade there, having about 40
Moors on board, with a Dutch pilot, boatswain
and gunner, which said ship the narrator
hailed and commanded” [? The Master]
“on board. And with him came eight or
nine of the Moors and the three Dutchmen
who declared it was a Moor’s ship and”
(were) “demanded their pass from Surrat,
which they showed and the same was a
French pass which he believes was shown
by mistake. For the pilot swore sacramentally
she was a prize and staid on board the
<i>Galley</i> and would not return on board the
Moor’s ship, but went in the <i>Galley</i> to the
port of St. Marie’s.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>This statement is corroborated by such of
his crew as returned with him to America,
from whose depositions it further appears
that all the Christians ultimately remained
in the <i>Galley</i> and “took up arms there,”
that the Moors had the long boat given
them to go on shore, which was two leagues
distant; and that Captain Kidd and his
men sold the cotton and horses to the natives
of the country for money and gold, but kept
the ship itself with them and carried her to
Madagascar, the <i>Galley</i> being very leaky.
The King’s evidence against Kidd was practically
to the same effect.</p>

<p>This was a prize of no great value, but
such as it was he and his men were no doubt
glad enough to lay hands on it. For they
must by this time have been running short of
money, and it was the first capture they had
made. Moreover, their own ship being very
leaky, they were glad to keep it in company.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, on the fifth of February,
1698, they came across a very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
ship, the <i>Quedagh Merchant</i>, an extremely
valuable prize. Sailing under
French colours, as Kidd frankly admits
“with a design to decoy,” he met, to quote
his own words, “with a Bengal merchantman
belonging to Surratt of the burden of
four or five hundred tons, and he commanded
the master on board. And a
Frenchman, an inhabitant of Surratt, and
belonging to the French factory there, came
on board as master; and when he came on
board the narrator caused the English
colours to be hoisted and the said master
was surprised and said, ‘You are English,’
and asking which was the captain. Whom
when he saw, he said, ‘Here is a good prize,’
and delivered him the French pass.”</p>

<p>There is no reason to believe that this is
not a perfectly correct account of the taking
of the ship; but for the capture of which it
is improbable that any complaint against
Kidd would ever have been made by the
East India Company. Kidd’s own account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of the capture is corroborated even by
the King’s evidence, Bradenham, who states
that Kidd chased the ship under French
colours, and that when he came up with her
he commanded the master on board. “And
there came,” he says, “an old Frenchman in
the boat; and after he had been aboard
awhile” (mark the subtlety of the word
“awhile.” Who would have conceived that
it meant five or six days?), “he told Captain
Kidd that he was not the captain but
the gunner, and Kidd sent for the captain,
whose name was Wright.” Palmer, the
other King’s evidence, says he was not on
board when the ship was taken. At the
trial Kidd went more fully into this incident
than in his narrative. “My lord,” he
said, “this Frenchman was aboard for five
or six days before I understood there was
any Englishman aboard. ‘Well?’ said I.
‘What are you?&mdash;an Englishman?’ ‘I
am, master.’ ‘What have you to show for
it?’ ‘Nothing.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately the French passes given to
Kidd on the taking of both prizes were carefully
preserved by him. He sent them to
the Earl of Bellamont on his first arrival in
American waters, and Bellamont forwarded
them to the Admiralty. They were included
amongst the papers relating to Kidd,
delivered in at the clerk’s table of the House
of Commons by the chairman of the committee
appointed to sort the papers received
from Bellamont and report thereon. Verbatim
copies of them are to be found in the
Journals of the House of Commons (Vol.
18, page 21), and are printed in Appendix
C of this work. They constitute the most
important documentary evidence that could
have been forthcoming at Kidd’s trial; but
although the Admiralty officials had them
in their possession, and the House of Commons
had directed that Kidd should have
access to them, and although Kidd pleaded
hard for a postponement of his trial in order
that they might be produced, not only were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
they not produced, but the jury and judge
were led to suppose that they existed only
in Kidd’s imagination.</p>

<p>The belated suggestion made by the Englishman
Wright that he was the master of
the ship, coupled with an offer on the part
of the Armenians to redeem the prize for
twenty thousand rupees, a wholly inadequate
sum,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> seems to have raised some doubt
in Kidd’s cautious Scotch mind as to the
expediency of carrying off the ship to
America in accordance with his sailing
orders. He called his crew on deck and consulted
them as to the course they should
take. They voted not to accept the proffered
ransom but to take her to Madagascar,
which he decided to do, Madagascar lying
in the direct route for America. His sailing
orders<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> from Bellamont as to the course he
should take with any prizes were explicit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
They were: “You are to sail directly to
Boston or New England, there to deliver to
me the whole of the prizes, treasure, merchandise,
and other things you shall have
taken by virtue of the powers and authorities
granted you.” The only contingency in
which he might depart from them was, “if
you shall fall in with any English ship
bound for England having good convoy,
you are in such case to keep them company
and bring all your prizes to London.” It
is difficult to see how, in the face of these
orders, he could have done otherwise than
take his two prizes to Madagascar.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he set sail at once
with both; and according to his narrative
“sailing thither the <i>Galley</i> was so leaky
that they feared she would have sunk every
hour; and it required eight men every two
glasses to keep her free; and” (he) “was
forced to woold her round with cables to
keep her together, and with much ado
carried her into the port of St. Marie’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
where they arrived the first day of April,
1698.”</p>

<p>On her way to Madagascar the <i>Adventure
Galley</i> unfortunately seems to have
fallen in with a Portuguese ship. According
to the deposition<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of William Jinkins,
a London lad, one of the boys who had remained
faithful to Kidd, “she also in her
passage to St. Marie’s aforesaid took a
Bark or Ship, navigated with Portuguese.
She came from Bengall and was bound to
Goa, and had on board, Bengalls, Muslins,
Calicoes, and other things, which the <i>Galley’s</i>
Company began to plunder and bring
on board the <i>Galley</i>: but seeing several
Ships coming towards them the said <i>Galley</i>
with the other two prizes she had taken,
came to sail, and left the said last Prize at a
place between Brin John and Angingo, so
called from being an English and Dutch
factory; and left on board the same all the
company belonging thereto, except the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Master Merchant and seven men more that
had come on board the <i>Galley</i>, when she
first took the said Ship.” This deposition
made two years before Kidd’s trial was confirmed
in substance by two other lads, Barlicorn
and Lumley. At the trial, Bradenham,
the King’s evidence, told the story
thus: “We met with a Portuguese ship off
the coast of Malabar and he” (<i>i. e.</i>, Kidd)
“took her and he took out of her some
opium, some East India goods, some plunder
and sixty or seventy bags of rice.”
Asked by Kidd whether he had seen them
brought on board, Bradenham evaded the
question by saying: “I am answering the
bench.” In reply to a further question by
the Solicitor General, “Were there any
other goods,” he replied: “Yes, there was
bees’ wax and thirty jars of butter.”</p>

<p>This is the only vessel with respect to
which there is any good ground for suspecting
that Kidd’s proceedings were irregular.
His omission to make any reference to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
ship in his narrative is significant; and
points to the conclusion that he felt some
difficulty in justifying what had been done.
It is not improbable that he was forced by
stress of circumstances to acquiesce in what
was undoubtedly an act of piracy on the
part of his crew, though it may have been
regarded by them as a very justifiable reprisal
for the damage and loss of life which
the <i>Galley</i> had sustained by the recent unprovoked
attack of the Portuguese man-of-war.
That Kidd was placed by their action
in this case in great difficulty is obvious. In
their then temper, it is unlikely that if he
had had time to reason with them, he could
have induced them to return to the Portuguese
the goods they had wrongfully
brought on board the <i>Galley</i>. As it was, the
sudden appearance of several other ships
bearing down on them left him no alternative,
but either to make off at once, or to
hand over the wrongdoers to be dealt with
by their enemies, who might in the meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
themselves make off with his two lawful
prizes. Kidd’s paramount object during
his voyage seems to have been to do his
best for his employers, and he may well have
thought that it was not to their interest that
he should await the arrival of the approaching
ships.</p>

<span class="smaller">KIDD’S RETURN HOME</span></p>

<p>Had Kidd been fortunate enough on
his first visit to Madagascar to find his
pirates there, it is possible but not very
probable that his crew might have done their
best to kill or catch their fellow-countrymen,
who were preying on the Indian commerce.
On the other hand, had he not been so unfortunate
as to find the pirates awaiting him
there on his way back to Boston, he would
probably have been able to bring his two
prizes home safely within a reasonable time
and have ended his voyage to the satisfaction
of his employers and with credit to himself.
Even as it was, had he been in command
of a disciplined crew, as determined
as their captain was, faithfully to discharge
the painful duties they had undertaken, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
finding the pirates at St. Marie’s would have
given him a fair chance of crowning his patient
efforts with a success which might have
been handed down to posterity as a proof
of the fortitude by which a great Scotch
sea captain had been able to surmount apparently
insuperable difficulties. But it
would be hard to find in history, sacred or
profane, an unluckier man than Kidd. The
<i>Adventure Galley</i> came back to Madagascar
in a sinking condition, with her crew on
the brink of mutiny, worn out with repeated
mishaps, having lost a large number of their
fellows by sickness, disgusted at the ill-luck
and strait-laced proceedings of their conscientious
commander, in possession, it is
true, of a rich prize, but in some doubt,
owing to his hesitation in retaining her,
whether, when they got to Boston, questions
as to the legality of the capture, to say nothing
of their recent misconduct in rifling the
Portuguese ship, might not be raised, ending
in their getting no pay whatever for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
between two and three years’ heavy and
perilous work, and possibly in their being
thrown into gaol by Bellamont for piracy.
Probably they would have mutinied long
before, if they could have found a capable
leader with the necessary knowledge of
navigation to take Kidd’s place. As it was,
when they found their fellow-countrymen
at St. Marie’s, living on the fat of the land
on cargoes taken from the Moors, under an
adventurous and successful commander,
Culliford, who had stolen an East Indiaman
from his employers, and was now reaping a
rich harvest from his villainy, it was no wonder
that the greater part of Kidd’s men at
once decided to throw in their lot with him,
rather than stand by Kidd in an internecine
struggle with their fellow-countrymen, in
which success was more than doubtful, and if
attained would necessitate their carrying
their conquered compatriots in chains to an
English port, there to be handed over to the
authorities with a view to their being hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
as pirates, for what was regarded by the majority
of the seamen on both sides as the
very venial offence of plundering the enemies
of Christianity. The catastrophe
which now befell was the inevitable sequence
of what had gone before, and what Kidd
found awaiting him on his arrival at Madagascar.</p>

<p>Let him tell the tale in his own simple
words.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>“When the Narrator arrived at the said
Port, there was a Pirate Ship, called the
<i>Moca Frigate</i>, at an anchor, Robert Culliford
Commander thereof, who with his men
left the same at his coming and ran into the
woods. And the Narrator proposed to his
men to take the same, having sufficient
power and authority so to do. But the mutinous
crew told him, ‘If he offered the
same, they would rather fire ten guns into
him than one into the other,’ and thereupon
ninety-seven men deserted, and went into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the <i>Moca Frigate</i>, and sent into the woods
for the said pirates, and brought the said
Culliford and his men on board again, and
all the time he stayed in the said port the
said deserters sometimes in great numbers
came on board the said <i>Galley</i> and <i>Adventure
Prize</i>, and carried away great guns,
Powder, Shot, small arms, sails, Anchors,
Cables, Surgeon’s chest, and what else they
pleased; and threatened several times to
murder the Narrator, as he was informed
and advised to take care of himself, which
they designed in the night to effect; but
was [<i>sic</i>] prevented by his locking himself
in his cabin at night, and securing himself
by barricading the same with bales of goods
and having about forty small arms besides
pistols, ready charged to keep them out.”</p>

<p>“Their wickedness was so great that after
they had plundered and ransacked sufficiently,
they went five miles off to one Edward
Welche’s house, where his, the Narrator’s
chest was lodged, and broke it open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and took out ten ounces of gold, 40 pound of
plate, 370 pieces of eight, the Narrator’s
Journal, and a great many papers that belonged
to him and the People of New York
that fitted them out.”</p>

<p>“About the fifteenth of June, the <i>Moca
Frigate</i> went away, being manned with
about 130 men and forty guns bound out
to take all nations. It was then that the
Narrator was left only with 13 men, so that
the Moors he had to pump and keep the
<i>Adventure Galley</i> above water being carried
away, she sank in the harbour, and the
Narrator with the said thirteen men went
on board the <i>Adventure Prize</i>.”</p>

<p>Let us try to put ourselves in Kidd’s
place, when the bulk of his men went over
to the enemy. Forcibly deprived of his command
at the moment when he saw success
within his grasp; deserted by nearly all his
crew; plundered of the greater part of the
spoil he was taking home to his employers;
on board the sinking <i>Adventure Galley</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
confined to his stifling cabin with its barricaded
approaches. What course can it be
suggested that he could have taken and have
been held blameless by an English court?
What course ought any man to have taken
in his place who sought to do his duty by his
owners?</p>

<p>It would have been a mercy to him and
to his memory, if the mutineers had then and
there made an end of him. But to have done
this, they must have stormed his cabin, and
they dared not try it. They knew his fighting
record. They had been with him in his
encounter with the Portuguese man-of-war.
None knew better than they that he would
sell his life dearly. Let us hope, too, that
some few of his crew stood by him in this
emergency, with “the forty loaded small
arms, besides pistols.” But although the
pirates and mutineers could not make an
end of him, it was equally impossible for him
to take the offensive against them. If
neither party could attack, the situation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
could only be relieved by diplomacy. The
ultimate solution has been handed down to
us by the doubtful testimony of one or two
of those who were there. We are left to
conjecture the intermediate stages of the
arrangement.</p>

<p>According to the evidence the <i>Adventure
Galley</i> was brought into the port on the first
of April, in company with its smaller prize.
The <i>Quedagh Merchant</i> did not come in
until some weeks afterwards. The <i>Moca
Frigate</i>, as already stated, went away on
the fifteenth of June, leaving Kidd and thirteen
men behind. In the interval some kind
of a compact seems to have been come to, by
which Kidd undertook not to molest the
pirates, and Culliford agreed to let Kidd
keep the <i>Quedagh Merchant</i> and a certain
quantity of the goods on board of her. It
is difficult to see how Kidd in his then position
could have made a better bargain than
this for the great men who were employing
him. Judging from the amount of specie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and goods which he succeeded after all in
bringing to America, he appears to have
done very well indeed for them. Possibly
the canny Scot, notwithstanding the theft of
his chest, had more gold and valuables concealed
in his impenetrable cabin than the deserters
dreamed of. Possibly some of his
late crew had consciences and were willing
to let him off cheaply. Whatever the details
of the arrangement may have been, it is unlikely
that he could in any case have saved
himself from the charge brought against
him at his trial, on which the judge laid
great stress, and which has clung to him
ever since, that having been sent out to catch
the pirates, and bring them home with him,
he had on the first occasion on which he had
met them, promised not to molest them, an
offence which it was alleged at his trial that
he had aggravated by drinking deeply from
a tub of “bomboo” with their Captain Culliford.</p>

<p>The word “bomboo” has a fine piratical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
suggestiveness about it. It sounds as if
it were some weird concoction of strong
liquors, which carousing pirates in their unholy
orgies were wont to consume by the
bucketfull. As a matter of fact, it was a
very innocent beverage made of water, limes,
and sugar; and it was small blame to poor
Kidd that on emerging from his beleaguered
cabin in that hot climate, he was glad
enough to take a long drink of it, when at
length a truce had been arranged. According
to the King’s evidence at his trial, he
solemnly undertook over this draught of
“bomboo” not to molest the pirates, and
presumably they also undertook not to
molest him. The alternative very possibly
was his death from thirst in his stuffy cabin.
Culliford’s men outnumbered his by ten to
one. The only evidence besides his own that
we have of this incident was that given at
his trial by two of his crew, who had deserted
him and gone over to the enemy. Kidd not
unnaturally was very bitter against these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
two men,&mdash;Bradenham the surgeon and
Palmer, one of his seamen&mdash;as appears
from the following quotations from the verbatim
report of his trial.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd</span> (<i>to Bradenham</i>). “Did you not
come aboard my ship and rob the surgeon’s
chest?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradenham.</span> “No, I did not.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “Did I not come to you when you
went away and met you on the deck, and
said, ‘Why do you take the chest away?’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradenham.</span> “No, I did not do it.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “You are a rogue.”</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “Mr. Bradenham, are you not
promised your life to take away mine?”</p>

<p>Mr. Justice <span class="smcap">Turton</span>. “He is not bound
to answer that question. He is very fit to
be made an evidence of the King. Perhaps
there can be no other in this case than such
who are in his circumstances.”</p>

<p>In other words, those of the crew who had
faithfully stood by their captain, and helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
him to bring his prize home to America in
the interests of their employers, one of
whom was the King himself, could not be
relied on as witnesses. The only witnesses
who could be trusted to swear through thick
and thin against Kidd, were two men who
by their own admission had deserted their
colours and joined Culliford in open piracy
against the ships of all nations.</p>

<p>To quote again from the verbatim report:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “I hope the King’s counsel will
not put him in the way. It is hard that a
couple of rascals should take away the
King’s subjects’ lives. They are a couple
of rogues and rascals.”</p>

<p>Again, when one of them conveniently
feigned ignorance, and an answer by the
other had been suggested to him by one of
the counsel for the prosecution:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “It is a fine trade that you must
take away so many of the King’s subjects’
lives, and know nothing at all of the
matter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, speaking this time to the judge:</p>

<p>“It is a fine trade indeed that he must be
instructed what to say. He knows no more
of these things than you do. The fellow
used to sleep five or six months together in
the hold.”</p>

<p>Once more:</p>

<p>“He tells a thousand lies. The man contradicts
himself a hundred times.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd</span> (<i>speaking this time to Palmer</i>).
“I would not go with such a roguish crew
as you were. Was I not threatened to be
shot in my cabin by such villains as you, if
I would not go along with you? This was
the reason I could not come home. Did you
not with the others set fire to the boat to
destroy my ship? My lord, they took what
they pleased out of the ship, and I was
forced to stay by myself, and pick up here
a man and there a man to carry her home.”</p>

<p>That Kidd had no option but to stay on
at Madagascar after Culliford had left is
obvious. The faithful thirteen who remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
behind with him were clearly an insufficient
ship’s company to bring the <i>Quedagh
Merchant</i> with her freight safely to
America. When he left her off the coast of
Hispaniola, nearly a year afterwards, denuded
of the specie and goods which he had
taken from her to Boston, she carried besides
her thirty mounted guns, taken from
the <i>Adventure Galley</i>, twenty more guns of
her own, stowed away in her hold, some two
hundred bales of calicoes, silks, and muslins,
between eighty and ninety tons of refined
sugar, forty tons of saltpetre, and ten tons
of iron “in short junks.” No reason, other
than stern necessity, can have induced him
to prolong his stay at Madagascar. He and
his men must have wished to get home as
soon as might be. Had they been able to
start at once, they might have been in time
to put an end to the suspicions of their honesty,
which were already accumulating in
England owing to the protracted absence of
news as to their movements, and the complaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the East India Company of the
seizure of the <i>Quedagh Merchant</i>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Madagascar was one of
the last places in the world in which Kidd
was likely to find the men required to bring
his ship home. The majority of such English-speaking
men as were there were by
no means desirous of bringing themselves
within the grasp of the law. In the course
of the next five months, to quote his own
words, “he picked up here a man and there
a man,” and “some passengers presented
that were bound for these parts,” <i>i. e.</i>,
America. At last, still under-manned, he
started on his homeward voyage, and
reached Anguilla in the West Indies in
April, 1699. By this time he had been condemned
unheard by the home authorities;
and the hue and cry had been raised against
him and such of his crew as had remained
faithful. The lords justices had sent instructions
to the governors of all the English
colonies in America “to apprehend him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and his accomplices, whenever he or they
should arrive in any of the said plantations,”
and “to secure his ship and all the effects
therein, it being their Excellencies’ intention
that right be done to those who have
been injured and robbed by the said Kidd,
and that he and his associates be prosecuted
with the utmost rigour of the law.” Consequently
when, in all innocence, he sent his
boat on shore, to quote again from his own
artless narrative, “his men had the news
that he and his people were proclaimed
pirates, which put them into such consternation
that they sought all opportunities to
run the ship ashore upon some reef or shoal,
fearing the Narrator should carry them into
some English port.”</p>

<p>“From Anguilla,” he tells us, “they came
to St. Thomas, where his brother-in-law,
Samuel Bradley, was put on shore being
sick, and five more” (out of his small crew)
“went away and deserted him. There he
heard the same news, that he and his company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
were proclaimed pirates, which incensed
the people more and more.”</p>

<p>“From St. Thomas he set sail for Moona,
an island between Hispaniola and Porto
Rico, where they met with a sloop, called the
<i>St. Anthony</i>, bound for Antigua from
Curaso. The men on board then swore that
they would bring the ship no further.” By
this time some commanders would have hesitated.
Not so Kidd. He held to his purpose
to remain true to his employers whatever the
cost to himself might be. He tells us, and
his evidence is not contradicted, that he
“then sent the said sloop, <i>St. Anthony</i>, to
Curaso for canvas to make sails for the
prize, she not being able to proceed, and she
returned in ten days, and after the canvas
came he could not persuade the men to carry
her to New England. But six of them went
and carried their chests and things on board
of the Dutch sloop, bound for Curaso, and
would not so much as heel the vessel, or do
anything.” The remainder of the men not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
being able to bring the <i>Adventure Prize</i> to
Boston “he secured her in a good safe harbour
in Hispaniola and left her in the possession
of Mr. Henry Boulton of Antigua,
Merchant, with three of the old men and
fifteen or sixteen of the men that belonged
to the said sloop <i>St. Anthony</i> and a brigantine
belonging to Mr. Burt of Curaso.” He
then “bought the said sloop, <i>St. Anthony</i>, of
Mr. Boulton for the owners’ account: and
after he had given directions to the said
Boulton to be careful of the ship and lading,
and persuaded him to stay three months
until he returned, he made the best of his
way to New York.”</p>

<p>Bellamont was not at New York, but at
Boston. An old friend of Kidd’s, Emmot
by name, came on board the sloop from New
York, and to him Kidd told his simple tale,
handed over to him the two invaluable
French passes to take to Bellamont, as evidence
that the two prizes, in respect of which
he had been charged with piracy, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
lawfully taken under his letters of marque.
On the thirteenth of June, Emmot came to
Bellamont at Boston with these passes, and
two days afterwards Bellamont sent Mr.
Duncan Campbell, the Postmaster of Boston,
to invite Kidd to come into the port of
Boston. On the nineteenth Campbell returned,
and gave in a memorial,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> still extant,
of all that had passed between him and
Kidd.</p>

<p>This memorial is of interest, as showing
the effect produced on Bellamont’s emissary
by his first interview with Kidd. Had he
been prejudiced in Kidd’s favor, it is unlikely
that he would have been selected by
Bellamont for the purpose of ascertaining
whether Kidd was guilty of piracy or not.
On the same day he was sent back by Bellamont
to Kidd, with the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, 19 June, 1699.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Captain Kidd</span>,&mdash;Mr. Emmot came to
me last Tuesday night telling me he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
from you: but was shy of telling where he
parted with you. Nor did I press him to it.
He told me you came by Oyster Bay in
Nassau Island and sent for him to New
York. He proposed to me that I would
grant you a pardon. I answered that I had
never granted one yet, and that I had set
myself a rule never to grant a pardon to
anybody without the King’s express leave
or command. He told me you declared and
protested your innocence and that if your
men could be persuaded to follow your example,
you would make no manner of scruple
of coming into this port, or any other
within His Majesty’s Dominions. That
you owned there were two ships taken, but
that your men did it violently and against
your will, and had used you barbarously, in
imprisoning you and treating you ill the
most part of your voyage, and often attempting
to murder you. Mr. Emmot delivered
to me the two French passes taken
on board the two ships your men rifled,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
which passes I have in my custody, and I
am apt to believe they will be a good article
to justify you, if the late peace were not by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the Treaty between England and France to
operate in that part of the world at the time
the hostility was committed, as I am almost
confident it was not to do. Mr. Emmot told
me that you showed a great sense of honour
and justice in professing with many asseverations
your settled and serious design all
along to do honour to your Commission and
never to do the least thing contrary to your
duty and allegiance to the King. And this
I have to say in your defence, that several
persons in New York, who I can bring to
evidence it, did tell me that by several advices
from Madagascar and that part of the
world, they were informed of your men’s
revolting from you in one place, and I am
pretty sure they said was Madagascar, and
that others compelled you much against
your will to take and rifle two ships.</p>

<p>“I have advised with His Majesty’s
Council, and shewed them this letter, and
they are of opinion that if you can be so clear
as you (or Mr. Emmot for you) have said,
<em>that you may safely come hither, and be
equipped and fitted out to go and fetch the
other ship, and I make no manner of doubt
but to obtain the King’s pardon for you, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
for those few men you have left who I understand
have been faithful to you, and
refused as well as you to dishonour the
Commission you have from England.</em></p>

<p>“<em>I assure you on my Word and Honour I
will perform nicely what I have promised</em>,
though this I declare beforehand that whatever
goods and treasure you may bring
hither, I will not meddle with the least bit of
them: but they shall be left with such persons
as the Council shall advise until I receive
orders from England how they shall
be disposed of.”</p>

</div>

<p>Kidd’s reply to this letter was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To the <span class="smcap">Earl of Bellamont</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">From Block Island on Board the Sloop Anthony</span></p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">24 June, 1699</span>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">May it please your Excellency</span>,</p>

<p>“I am honoured with your Lordship’s letter
of the 19th instant by Mr. Campbell,
which came to my hands this day. For
which I return my most hearty thanks. I
cannot but blame myself for not writing to
your Lordship before this time, knowing it
was my duty: but the clamours and false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
stories that have been reported of me, made
me fearful of visiting or coming into any
harbour, till I could hear from your Lordship.</p>

<p>“I note the contents of your Lordship’s
letter, as to what Mr. Emmot and Mr.
Campbell informed your Lordship of my
proceedings I do affirm to be true, and a
great deal more might be said of the abuses
of my men, and the hardships I have undergone
to preserve the ship and what goods my
men had left. Ninety-five men went away
from me in one day and went on board the
<i>Moca Frigate</i>, Captain Robert Culliford,
Commander, who went away to the Red
Sea; and committed several acts of piracy,
as I am informed; and am afraid (the men
formerly belonging to my <i>Galley</i>) that the
report is gone home against me to the East
India Company, that I have been the actor.
A sheet of paper will not contain what may
be said of the care I took to preserve the
owners’ interest, and to come home to clear
my own innocency. I do further declare
and protest that I never did in the least act
contrary to the King’s Commission, nor to
the reputation of my honourable owners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and doubt not but that I shall be able to make
my innocence appear; or else I had no need
to come to these parts of the world; if it
were not for that and my owners’ interest.
There are Five or Six Passengers that came
from Madagascar to assist me in bringing
the ship home, and about ten of my own
men, that came with me would not venture
to go into Boston, till Mr. Campbell had engaged
Body for Body for them that they
should not be molested while I stayed at
Boston, or till I return with the ship. I
doubt not but your Lordship will write to
England in my favour and for these few
men who are left.</p>

<p>“I wish your Lordship would persuade Mr.
Campbell to go home to England with your
Lordship’s letters, who will be able to give
account of our affairs and diligently follow
the same that there may be a speedy answer
from England. I desired Mr. Campbell to
buy 1000 weight of Rigging for fitting of
the ship to bring her to Boston, that I may
not be delayed when I come there.</p>

<p>“Upon receiving of your Lordship’s letter,
I am making the best of my way to Boston.
This with my humble duty to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Lordship and Countess, is what offers from,

<p>On the first of July he brought the sloop

Boston, conscious of his integrity and relying

<span class="smaller">THE GENESIS AND GROWTH OF THE ARCH PIRATE MYTH</span></p>

<p>Kidd’s expedition having originated in
the desire of the government to placate
the East India Company, it is only
reasonable to surmise that the Company received
some early official intimation of what
was being done on their behalf. To what
extent they were informed officially of the
details of the government scheme is of comparatively
small importance. The great
wealth at their disposal and the prodigality
with which they expended their secret service
money in those days, leave no room for
doubt that at a very early stage of the proceedings
they made themselves acquainted
with the essential facts. Their factories
were exposed to imminent danger from the
irritation of the Great Mogul at the continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
robbery of his subjects’ goods by English-speaking
seamen on his coasts. The
Company must have taken the keenest interest
in the measures designed for the
repression of this piracy. With their practical
knowledge of the difficulties to be encountered,
it is unlikely that they at any time
regarded the adventurers’ project as a very
promising one. When they heard of the
failure of the Admiralty to protect Kidd’s
carefully selected crew from the press gang,
and realised that the bulk of the ship’s company
would have to be got from New York,
it is impossible that they can have entertained
any illusions as to the probability of
its success.</p>

<p>Kidd’s crew was pressed at the Nore on
the first of March, 1696. By one of the
curious close coincidences of date which
speak for themselves in this case more convincingly
than any words can do, the Company
on the following day addressed a petition
to the Admiralty, praying to be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to take the business of dealing with the
pirates into their own hands. In this petition
they urged that “Your Lordships will
please to empower the petitioners’ ships and
officers to seize and take all pirates infesting
those seas within the limits of the Company’s
charter and likewise empower them to
erect a Court of Admiralty in those parts.”
This proposal except for a very excusable
technical error contained in it, which if not
corrected, would have enabled the Company,
instead of the Admiralty, to create a Court
of Admiralty, was not unreasonable. It
was referred by the Admiralty to their
judge, Sir Charles Hedges, who promptly
reported in the following terms on the steps
necessary to carry it into effect: “That the
more regular way will be for your Lordships
to take a Commission under the Great
Seal of England giving power to the Lord
Admiral or Commissioners for executing
the office of High Admiral to grant commissions
to any of the Captains of the East<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
India Company’s ships for the taking of the
ships of pirates, wherein it shall be expressed
what parts or shares the King shall
see fit to reserve to himself or bestow upon
the Captors and Company.”</p>

<p>“That your Lordships may be pleased to
erect a Vice-Admiralty at Bombay or any
other place that shall be thought expedient
in the same manner as is done in the West
Indies, which being established by a commission
in the ordinary form, that will be
sufficient to empower such Vice-Admiralty
there, to proceed against ships as fully as
any Vice-Admiralty in England or the
High Court of Admiralty can do.”</p>

<p>Why no action was taken on this proposal
of the Company as modified by Sir Charles
Hedges, is not clear. Possibly the Admiralty
hesitated to hand over to the captains
of the Company’s ships work which they
thought more properly belonged to the
King’s navy, and which when the French
war was ended was very soon performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
by Captain Warren’s squadron. Possibly
they felt a delicacy in doing anything that
might diminish the great ministers’ chances
of gain from Kidd’s adventure. What
seems to have happened is that the Company’s
petition was officially shelved for
nearly four years, when Captain Warren
having in the meanwhile been sent out with
five men-of-war to suppress the pirates, it
was referred to the committee of the House
of Commons, who had then been appointed
to consider further the large question of the
state and condition of the trade of England,
by whom, if considered at all, it would have
to run the gauntlet of many implacable enemies
of the Company, and in particular of
certain ardent protectionists of that day
who never missed an opportunity of holding
forth on the injuries to which English
industries were exposed by the importation
by the Company of Indian silks, calicoes, and
muslins.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from any question of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the probable success of Kidd’s expedition,
or the desirability of giving the Company a
free hand to deal themselves with the pirates,
the terms of the grant of the spoil to the
adventurers, with which the Company had
evidently made themselves familiar, were calculated
to place them in a very awkward
position with the Great Mogul. What they
had to protect themselves against, was a
summary expulsion from his dominions;
and they must have realized that even if
Kidd succeeded in catching his pirates, it
would be a very unsatisfactory reply to the
demands of that great potentate for the immediate
restitution of the stolen properties,
to assure him that the thieves had been
carried to England, where it was to be
hoped that some of them might in due course
be convicted, and possibly hung; but that
the stolen goods had in the meanwhile been
appropriated by some of the King’s great
ministers. It was not impossible that the
next demand of the Great Mogul might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that these great gentlemen together with
such of the directors of the Company as had
acquiesced in this arrangement should at
once be handed over to him to be dealt with
according to their deserts. It is not, therefore,
surprising to find that on the twentieth
of August in that year, whilst Kidd was still
at New York trying to pick up his crew, the
Company presented a further petition to the
Lords Justices, praying that “such of the
species of gold, silver and jewels as have already
been or shall hereafter be seized in
the custody of any of the pirates or any
other persons who cannot make a legal title
thereunto, may not be disposed of, but put
into the possession of the Company, in order
to be preserved for the use of the proprietors
in India, that the Government may see
that His Majesty as well as the Company
have done their utmost endeavours to seize
the said pirates and to make restitution to
the persons injured so far as it is in their
power.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>In taking this course the Company must
have realized that it would be very distasteful
to the King and his four great ministers,
who were proposing themselves to appropriate
the bulk of the spoil. But they also
knew that these great men had placed themselves
hopelessly in the wrong; and that
there were plenty of their enemies in the
House of Commons who would be only too
eager to expose the scandal, when the time
came for them to do so. This consideration
seems to have had some weight with the
Lords Justices, and prevented them from
shelving this petition as unceremoniously as
the Admiralty had done the former one.
Anxious to appease the Company, and at the
same time to safeguard the rights of the
adventurers, they decided at a meeting at
which the Duke of Shrewsbury, one of the
adventurers, was present, to send a peremptory
but guarded dispatch to the governors
of all the American plantations, requiring
them “to take all possible care, and use all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
due means for the seizing and apprehending
all such pirates and sea robbers and such as
may be reasonably suspected for the same,
either by reason of the great quantities of
gold and silver of foreign coins they usually
have with them, or by other probable circumstances;
and to cause them to be
straightly imprisoned, and their ships,
goods, and plunder to be kept in safe custody;
until upon returning to us a full
account of the said persons, ships, goods
and plunder, with the evidence relating to
them, His Majesty’s pleasure shall be known
and signified concerning them.” Amongst
the signatories to this despatch the name of
the Earl of Romney, another of the adventurers,
appears.</p>

<p>As might have been expected, this dispatch
produced little if any practical result.
During the next two years the Company continued
to receive repeated reports of the
depredations of the pirates, and the excitement
created thereby amongst the natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of India, who had in some cases seized the
Company’s factories and put the factors in
irons. Meanwhile the absence of any news
from Kidd had not unnaturally aroused the
suspicions of the Company. Culliford, the
captain of one of their own East Indiamen,
the <i>Moca Frigate</i>, had run away with their
ship from Madras and joined the pirates;
and it may have seemed to them by no means
improbable that Kidd with his American
crew had done the like. At length they received
some vague intimation, confirming
their suspicions; and in August, 1698, they
informed the Lords Justices “that they had
received <em>some</em> information from their factories
in the East Indies that Kidd had committed
several acts of piracy, particularly in
seizing a Moors’ ship called the <i>Quedagh
Merchant</i>.” As they produced no evidence
from their informants at Kidd’s trial in support
of these allegations, although they had
ample time and opportunity for obtaining it
during his two years’ imprisonment, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
unfair to assume that the information which
they received on this occasion was not such
as they cared to submit to an English Court
of Law. But such as it was, the Lords
Justices did not hesitate to act at once upon
it, and to assume without further inquiry
not only that Kidd was guilty, but that he
was already a notorious pirate. On the
twenty-third of November, 1698, whilst
Kidd was stranded at Madagascar, they
sent the following circular to Rear Admiral
Benbow, and the governor of every American
Colony: “The Lords Justices having
been informed by several advices from the
East Indies of the notorious piracies committed
by Captain Kidd, and of his having
seized and plundered divers ships in those
seas, as their Excellencies have given orders
to the commander of the squadron fitted out
for the East Indies that he use his utmost
endeavours to pursue and seize the said Kidd,
if he continue still in those parts, so likewise
they have commanded me to signify their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
directions to the respective governors of the
Colonies under His Majesty’s obedience in
America, that they give strict orders and
take particular care for apprehending the
said Kidd and his accomplices, whenever he
or they shall arrive in any of the said plantations,
as likewise that they shall secure his
ship and all the effects therein, it being
Their Excellencies’ intention that right be
done to those who have been injured and
robbed by the said Kidd, and that he and his
associates be prosecuted with the utmost
rigour of the law. You are to be careful,
therefore, to observe the said directions, and
if the said Kidd or any of his accomplices
be seized within the provinces under your
government, you are forthwith to transmit
an account thereof hitherto, and take care
that the said persons, ships and effects be
secured, till His Majesty’s pleasure is known
concerning them.”</p>

<p>It would appear from the wording of this
extraordinary and unjustifiable circular that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
the great men, who had sent Kidd out, had
by this time abandoned hope of getting any
gain out of their adventure, and that their
main desire now was to clear themselves of
the suspicion that they were conniving at
the alleged piracies of the distinguished officer,
whom they had induced against his own
misgivings to enter their service, and who
now was steadfastly doing his best for them
in the face of grievous difficulties at the
other end of the world. It may well be that
at this time they believed him to be guilty.
It may even be that they continued in this
belief when report after report came to hand
of the piracies of other English seamen in
the East, notwithstanding the marked absence
in those reports of any mention whatever
of Kidd or of the <i>Adventure Galley</i>.
Whether they continued to believe in his
guilt after his own narrative had been made
a Parliamentary paper, and he had been
examined before the House of Commons on
it, is a very different question. Neither they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
nor the Company were represented at the
trial, nor was any evidence then tendered on
their behalf. It was their interest to make
Kidd their scapegoat; and the interest of
the Company that some one, guilty or not,
the higher in rank the better, should be publicly
hung in infamy, as a warning to mariners
engaged in the Eastern piracy. It was
nobody’s interest in England that Kidd
should be acquitted, unless as a condition for
such acquittal he could be induced to make
compromising revelations against his employers.
And this, as will be seen, he resolutely
refused to do in the face of strong
temptation.</p>

<p>To return now to his relations with Bellamont,
who though appointed Governor of
New England as far back as June, 1695,
had not apparently started for America
until more than two years afterwards; and
had profitably employed the interval in obtaining
further favours from the government.
Not contented with the pension of five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
pounds per annum which had apparently
been given him on his dismissal by the
late Queen, in 1693, from his post as her Receiver
General, he seems to have succeeded
in May, 1696, in obtaining a further grant
of one thousand pounds a year out of the
forfeited estates of Lord Kilmeare, and in
March, 1697, to have been made colonel of
a regiment of foot. In the following June
it was announced that he would at last start
to his government in the <i>Deptford</i> frigate,
but he delayed his departure until October,
by which time he had succeeded in extracting
from the Treasury a further sop in the
shape of “twelve thousand pounds, paid
him in mault lottery tickets.”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>On the first of July, 1699, Kidd, as already
mentioned, landed at Boston, relying
on Bellamont’s word and honor, and assurance
that he believed that the two French
passes, which had been handed to him by
Emmot, would justify the seizure of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
prizes taken, and that he made no manner
of doubt that he could obtain the King’s
pardon for Kidd and for the few men left
who had continued faithful. It is easy to
understand the relief the old man must have
felt in setting foot in a civilized country once
more after all his troubles, with the knowledge
that he had served his employers so
well, and the expectation that he would now
receive recognition and reward for all he
had gone through on their behalf. Towards
the end of his voyage his wife and family
from New York had come on board, having
been informed of his whereabouts by his old
friend Emmot; and all of them were probably
looking forward to a warm reception on
their landing. If so, they were soon disillusionized.
The Governor declined to see Kidd
except in the most formal manner and in the
presence of witnesses. The truth was that
he had placed himself in a very awkward
position with the home authorities by inducing
the King’s ministers to embark in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
this unlucky adventure, and that he and they
had long since come to the conclusion that
the safest course to take to exonerate themselves
from the consequences was to make
a scapegoat of Kidd. Bellamont had been
playing a very double game, not only with
Kidd, but also with his own council. His
own admissions in his letters written to the
authorities in England before the end of
that month, leave no doubt on this point.
His consignment of Kidd to gaol was a foregone
conclusion; and the only difficulty he
had to get over, and it was an insuperable
one, was how to do this with some appearance
of decency. At the time when with
specious promises he was persuading his
victim to come to Boston, he was well aware
that it was his duty to arrest him immediately
on his landing there, in pursuance of
specific instructions from England, which he
had carefully concealed from his council.
The letter to Kidd with all its assumed belief
in Kidd’s innocence, and his own solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
assurances on his word and honour that he
could obtain the King’s pardon for him and
his men, was a trap laid for Kidd without
the knowledge of his council, to whom he
had submitted the letter for approval. His
intention throughout had been to get hold
of Kidd and send him to England, to be
dealt with there in such manner as might be
most convenient to the government. In his
letters he has not only confessed this, but has
even found it necessary to excuse himself to
his superiors and give the reasons which he
considered justified him in not arresting
Kidd the moment he landed. “It will not
be unwelcome news to your Lordships,” he
writes, “that I secured Captain Kidd last
Thursday in the gaol of this town. I
thought myself secure against his running
away, because I took care not to give him
the slightest umbrage of my design of seizing
him. Nor had I, until the day I produced
my orders from the Court to arrest
Kidd, communicated them to anybody. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
I found it necessary to produce my orders
to my Council to animate them to join heartily
in securing Kidd. Another reason why I
took him not up sooner, was that he had
brought his wife and family hither on the
sloop with him who (<i>sic</i>) I believed” (poor
wretch!) “he would not readily forsake.”
At the same time whilst thus excusing himself
for not arresting Kidd more promptly,
Bellamont seems to have felt that some explanation
was called for to justify his arresting
him at all. “Your Lordships may observe,”
he writes, and it requires a very
microscopical scrutiny of his hypocritical
letter to observe it, “that the promise made
Kidd in my letter of a kind reception, and
promising the King’s pardon for him, was
conditional, that is, provided that he was as
innocent as he pretended to be. But I
quickly found sufficient cause to suspect
him to be very guilty by the many lies and
contradictions he told me.” What these lies
and contradictions were, he is very careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
not to say. Kidd’s own narrative, corroborated
by the depositions of several of his
crew, are perfectly intelligible and straightforward
documents, far more intelligible
and convincing than Bellamont’s lame reasons
for thinking him guilty. The first of
these was that Kidd had communicated in
the first instance with his old friend Emmot,
who Bellamont says was “a cunning Jacobite
and my avowed enemy.” The second
reason assigned is, “I thought he looked
very guilty.” It is not improbable that poor
Kidd was taken aback by his cold reception;
but it is safe to assume that whatever his demeanor
had been, it would have been regarded
by the Governor as a sure sign of his
guilt. Sometimes during his examination
he seems to have been cheerful and breezy.
With what result? The Governor reports,
“Kidd did strangely trifle with me and the
Council three or four times that we had him
under examination.” Finding that his jocular
efforts were not appreciated, Kidd not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
unnaturally became grave. But the result
was still unsatisfactory. “He being examined
two or three times by the Council and
also some of his men, I observed,” says Bellamont,
“that he seemed much disturbed.”
The last time he was under examination, his
appearance seems again to have changed,
but still, as ever, for the worse. Probably
by this time he had grown restless and restive.
“I fancied,” Bellamont writes, “he
looked as if he were upon the wing and resolved
to run away.” But after all, the chief
offence for which the poor man was at last
consigned to gaol, was not committed by
him, but by his evil genius, Livingstone, who
asked Bellamont to return him the bond he
had entered into for Kidd’s good behaviour.
“I thought,” says Bellamont, “this was
such an impertinence that it was time for me
to look about me and secure Kidd.” On this
last point the version of the anonymous person
of quality is substantially the same as
Bellamont’s. “Above all,” he writes, “Livingstone’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
behaviour, who was come to Boston,
and very peremptorily demanded from
the Earl the delivery of the bond which he
had entered into for Kidd’s honest performance
of his duty in the expedition (as if that
was to be taken for granted) gave the Earl
of Bellamont good reason to conclude that
no time was to be lost. Therefore he caused
Kidd to be seized with divers of his crew.”
A lamer set of reasons for throwing a faithful
subordinate into gaol it would have been
difficult for the most unintelligent official to
concoct.</p>

<p>The reply of the Lords Justices to Bellamont’s
letters was the dispatch of a man-of-war,
the <i>Rochester</i>, to bring back Kidd and
his fellow-prisoners to England. This ship
set sail before the end of September; but
came back to Plymouth in November for
repairs. Her return led the opposition to
believe that the sending of her out had been
merely a pretence, and it was alleged that a
great number of other ships that had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
out in her company had been able to proceed
on their voyage and to reach New England
safely. The wildest rumours were in circulation.
The prevailing popular opinion seems
to have been that the four great ministers
had sent Kidd out in the <i>Adventure Galley</i>
to commit acts of piracy on their behalf;
and that they had naturally selected for this
purpose a past-master in the art of piracy.
Some would have it that Somers, to prevent
unpleasant disclosures, had already set the
great seal to his pardon. Evelyn, in his
diary of the third of December, says:
“They” (<i>i. e.</i>, Parliament) “called some
great persons in the highest offices in question
for setting the Greate Seale to the pardon
of an arch pirate, who had turned pirate
again, and brought prizes to the West Indies,
expecting to be connived at on sharing
the spoil.” Burnet, writing in much the same
strain, says, “It was maliciously insinuated
that the privateer turned pirate in confidence
of the protection of those who employed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
him, if he had not secret orders for
what he did.” It is difficult to say whose
reputation suffered more at this juncture&mdash;Kidd’s
by his association with the four unpopular
ministers, or the four unpopular
ministers, by their association with Kidd.</p>

<p>On the completion of her repairs, the
<i>Rochester</i> set sail again from Plymouth for
New York. She carried a letter from the
Lords Justices to Bellamont, approving his
zeal and conduct in the whole affair, and requiring
him to put the pirates and their
goods on board of her. The delay in bringing
Kidd to England, whether designed or
not, was most unfortunate for him and most
opportune for the ministers. The opposition
seem to have had some inkling that
Kidd’s return was being purposely delayed
with the object of enabling the government
to deal with him without consulting Parliament.
To allay these suspicions, a certificate
was produced signed by all the officers
of the <i>Rochester</i>, from which, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Bellamont’s apologist, it appeared that they
had proceeded on their course to America
“as far as their ship was able to bear the
beating of the sea and then resolved to return
to England.” “When they were returned
to England,” he says, “by a like
certificate they affirmed the same thing, and
that the result was taken merely for securing
the ship and the company’s lives.”
“The captain,” he adds, “by his letter to the
Secretary of the Admiralty says they were
got 500 leagues before they met the storms.
And orders being sent by the Admiralty to
Mr St Lo, the Commissioner of the Admiralty
at Plymouth, to examine into the
truth of the matter, he certified the Lords
of the Admiralty that in pursuance of their
commands he, with the assistance of the officers
of the Yard, had made a thorough survey
of the ship and (mentioning the several
particular defects) they unanimously found
there was a necessity for her coming back.”</p>

<p>These official assurances by no means satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the Commons. On the sixteenth of
the following March they presented an address
to the King, praying that Kidd might
not be tried, discharged, or pardoned until
the next session of Parliament, and that
Bellamont might be required in the meantime
to transmit over to England all commissions,
instructions, and other papers
taken with or relating to him.</p>

<p>The King’s reply to this address was communicated
to the House on the eighth of
April, 1700, by Mr. Secretary Vernon, who
informed the Commons that he had presented
the address to His Majesty, and that
His Majesty had commanded him to acquaint
the House that His Majesty having
received an account of the arrival of Captain
Kidd in the Isle of Lundy, by a ship which
the Lords of the Admiralty had sent to fetch
him, which was bound for the Downs, His
Majesty had ordered a yacht to be sent to
the Downs in order for the bringing of him
up, and that the commissioners of the Admiralty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
were likewise directed to send their
marshal to take him into custody.</p>

<p>This reply, so far from appeasing the opposition,
seems to have added fuel to the
flame of their indignation. Why could not
the King assent at once to their address?
Why had the <i>Rochester</i> gone out of her
course to the Isle of Lundy, unless it were
to defer the bringing home of Kidd until
Parliament had risen? Accordingly, a few
days afterwards, a further resolution was
moved that “An humble address be presented
to His Majesty to remove John,
Lord Somers, Lord Chancellor of England,
from his presence and counsels for ever.”
The motion was defeated by a majority of
one hundred and sixty-seven to one hundred
and six. But the fact that one hundred and
six members voted for it, shows the bitterness
of the party feeling against Somers,
and the widespread suspicions of his honesty
that prevailed amongst his political opponents.
It need hardly be said that these suspicions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
were not allayed by the well-timed
arrival of Kidd and his fellow-prisoners in
London on board the King’s yacht, on the
very day after Parliament had risen. The
result of this second curious close coincidence
of date which has occurred in the
course of this narrative, was that Kidd had
arrived too late to be examined by the members
of the House. He was therefore privately
examined by the Admiralty officials,
sent to Newgate, and ordered to be kept a
close prisoner.</p>

<p>The desire of the House of Commons that
Kidd should not be tried, discharged, or pardoned
until the next session of Parliament
was most unfortunate for him, because it
necessitated his being kept in confinement
with his fellow-prisoners at Newgate for
more than a year. But it cannot be regarded
as unreasonable, seeing that the
necessary documents relating to him had not
yet been laid before the House; that time
was required for the collection of evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
against him from abroad; and that such of
the facts relating to him and his employers
as had already been disclosed, afforded some
ground for suspecting that the four inculpated
ministers were far from blameless.
It is the one satisfactory feature in this very
unpleasant case, that no discredit attaches
to the action of the House of Commons in
respect of its treatment of Kidd, either in
this session or the next.</p>

<p>On the sixth of March in the following
year (1701), the House, having reassembled,
ordered that the examinations of Kidd and
all papers relating to him, transmitted by
the Earl of Bellamont (who, it may be mentioned,
was now dead), be laid before them
by the Admiralty. On the next day, they
were presented; and it was ordered that
such of them as came from the Admiralty
sealed up, be opened, and the private examinations
of Captain Kidd before the Admiralty
were accordingly opened and read. It
appeared from them that Kidd had denied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
that he had ever seen Shrewsbury or Somers;
or had heard more of them than that they
were two of his owners; that he admitted
that Bellamont had introduced him to the
Earl of Orford, and that Colonel Hewetson
had carried him to the Earl of Romney,
which was all he knew of them.</p>

<p>The papers delivered up by the Admiralty
related not only to Kidd, but also to
atrocities which had been committed in the
East Indies by pirates, who had nothing to
do with him, and which had apparently been
mixed up with his narrative, with the object
of obscuring the case and creating a prejudice
against him. The Commons appointed
a committee to sort them, and to report to
the House which of them related to Kidd.
On the twenty-seventh of March this committee
reported that they had done this; and
their chairman, Sir Humphrey Mackworth,
delivered them in at the clerk’s table, divided
into two parcels, one containing the papers
relating to Kidd, and the other the papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
that did not relate to him. Then Kidd’s private
examinations before the Admiralty were
again read; and Kidd, being brought in by
the keeper of Newgate, was called in. A
petition from Cogi Babba, which had been
presented to the House, was also read. This
petition is noteworthy as being the only
complaint to the House made by those who
were alleged at his trial to have been plundered
by him. It purported to be presented
by Cogi Babba, on behalf of himself and
other Armenians, inhabitants of Chalfa, the
suburb of Spahow, and subjects to the King
of Persia. It merely set forth that the petitioners
had freighted a ship called the <i>Karry
Merchant</i> (better known as the <i>Quedagh
Merchant</i>&mdash;and referred to in the French
pass as <i>Cara Marchand</i>), from Surat to
Bengal, where the petitioners loaded her at
prime cost to the value of four hundred
thousand rupees, besides forty thousand
rupees, the cost of the ship, which was all
taken and carried away by Captain Kidd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
on the ship’s returning to Surat about February,
1697; and it merely prayed that Kidd
might be examined touching the premises,
and the petitioners relieved concerning the
same.</p>

<p>After the reading of these papers Kidd
was examined and withdrew, and was remanded
to Newgate; and it was decided
that the House would the next day take into
consideration the patent, commission and
instructions to Kidd, which they did with
the result that a motion was made that the
grant passed under the Great Seal by
Somers to Bellamont and others of the goods
to be taken from the pirates before their
conviction was illegal and void. The question
being put, one hundred and eighty-five
members voted in favour of the motion and
one hundred and ninety-eight against it.</p>

<p>The House then decided that Kidd should
be put on his trial in the ordinary course;
and on the sixteenth of April, about three
weeks before it took place, being informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that he had sent to the Admiralty that he
might have the use of his commission and
some other papers at his trial, ordered that
“the said Commission and <em>such other papers
as Captain Kidd desires</em> be delivered by the
Clerk of this House to the Secretary of
the Admiralty.” Had this order been complied
with, and the papers been accessible to
Kidd or his legal advisers, he would have had
a complete answer to the charge of piracy
brought against him. For they included
the precious French passes, which had justified
his seizure of his two prizes.</p>

<span class="smaller">KIDD’S FIRST TRIAL AT THE OLD BAILEY</span></p>

<p>If any of the great personages involved
in Kidd’s case took the trouble to look
into the voluminous papers relating to it,
which had been sent over to England by
Bellamont for presentation to Parliament,
they must at once have realized that Kidd’s
prosecution was attended with great difficulties.
Notwithstanding the public prejudice
which had been aroused against him,
and the fact that he was not only a Scotchman,
but also a Colonial, they could hardly
have believed that an English jury could
be asked with safety to convict him of
piracy, on any of the grounds on which
Bellamont had committed him to gaol at
Boston, either because he had been described
by the Lords Justices as a notorious pirate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
or because he was thought to look guilty, or
because during his examination he had in
Bellamont’s opinion seemed at one time
unduly cheerful, and at another unduly
grave, or even because some one else had
been so impertinent as to ask prematurely
for the return of a bond. Kidd’s own simple
narrative, which it is impossible to doubt
that some of them must have read with interest,
if not with shame, supported as it
was by the depositions of such of his crew
as had remained faithful to him, contained
no inherent improbabilities, but bore the impress
of truth, and satisfactorily accounted
for his detention at Madagascar. No flaw
was apparent in either of the French passes,
which he had taken with his prizes, and
which were included amongst the papers
sent over by Bellamont. It is difficult to
believe that any one who read them failed
to come to the same conclusion that Bellamont
had expressed, that they would justify
the seizure of the two vessels to which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
related. The sole foundation for the suspicions
that attached to Kidd, apart from his
unfortunate and disreputable connection
with Lord Chancellor Somers, and other unpopular
members of the Ministry, was the
vague allegation made some years before by
the East India Company, that “they had
received some information from their factories
that he had committed several acts of
piracy, particularly in seizing the <i>Quedagh
Merchant</i>.” From the papers presented
to Parliament it seemed now clear that his
capture of that ship was justified; and that
he was on his way home with her to New
England with the object of getting her adjudicated
a lawful prize, when his men had
gone over to Culliford, and prevented him
from carrying her to Boston. As one at
least of the adventurers, Orford, the late First
Lord of the Admiralty, should have known,
she could not have been condemned as a lawful
prize in the East Indies, owing to the
neglect of the Admiralty to follow the advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of their own judge, to erect a Vice-Admiralty
Court there, as had been done in the
West Indies. The East India Company
must have been pressed after Kidd’s arrest,
to substantiate their vague charges against
him. It is inconceivable, having regard to
their interest in his conviction, that they left
any stone unturned to procure evidence
against him during the two years that he
remained in confinement. But whatever
their efforts may have been, they seem to
have been unsuccessful. No person was
found to come forward and allege that he
had any knowledge of Kidd’s alleged piracies,
except Cogi Babba, one of the owners
of the <i>Quedagh Merchant</i>. And for the
reason already explained, his evidence would
be valueless, if the French passes were produced
in Court.</p>

<p>But the Old Bailey practitioners of that
day, who were no doubt consulted in due
course, were adepts in their trade, and it is
unlikely that they entertained any serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
doubt from the first as to the lines on which
Kidd’s prosecution in the interests of their
clients should proceed, or as to its ultimate
success. They knew that he was friendless
and that it was nobody’s interest in England
but his own that he should be acquitted.
They knew that no London jury that tried
him could fail to be influenced by their
knowledge that he had been denounced by
the Lords Justices and the East India Company
as a notorious pirate, or dismiss from
their minds the innumerable wild tales which
had for years been disseminated to his disadvantage.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
They knew also, none better, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
practical difficulties which confronted every
poor wretch brought to trial in those days
on a capital charge by unscrupulous persons,
who could afford to bribe or terrify miscreants
into bearing false evidence against him.
Incredible as it may seem to us with our
modern notions of fair play and the belief
which has been instilled into some of us of
the wisdom of our ancient common law, much
of which was as hopelessly absurd as many
of the nostrums and theories of the medical
men of those days, accused persons in criminal
cases were forced to conduct their own
defence and were not allowed the assistance
of counsel, for the purpose of examining or
cross-examining witnesses or commenting
on any question of fact. Counsel on their
behalf were only permitted to address the
Court on questions of law; the legal fiction
being that there was no necessity for a prisoner
to employ counsel to elucidate the
facts: that the judge could be trusted to
see that this was properly done: and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the jury could be trusted to give the prisoner
the benefit of any reasonable doubt.
Needless to say this fiction led to the frequent
conviction of innocent persons, and
was a great encouragement to perjured witnesses.
Many a villain, who but for it
would have hesitated to be suborned, was
induced by it to come forward for a small
consideration and swear to anything that
his employers desired. Still more ready
were some poor creatures to do this, if they
had brought their own necks within measurable
distance of the noose, and their
refusal to swear away the life of the accused
would entail their own death by hanging.
In the present case, no trustworthy evidence
of reputable witnesses being forthcoming
against Kidd, the legal advisers of the Crown
very naturally had recourse to the well-known
last resort open to them, and set
themselves to find some one or more scoundrels,
who would be willing to turn King’s
evidence against him. Twelve seamen, most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of whom had remained faithful to their
commander, were now imprisoned with him,
awaiting their trial for piracy. We shall
never know how many of these were approached
by the prosecution. What we do
know is, that not one of them was induced
to become King’s evidence. If Kidd had
been guilty of the crimes of which he was
accused, this in itself would have been a
remarkable circumstance: for some of these
poor men might have been expected to
reconcile their consciences to the saving of
their own lives by giving evidence against
him. Not one of them did so. The only
witnesses who could be found to testify
against him were two rogues, who on their
own admission had deserted him at Madagascar,
and joined Culliford in open piracy
against all nations. These men had imprudently
returned to London, where unfortunately
for themselves and Kidd, they were
unearthed by emissaries of the prosecution
before the trial came on. Their lives would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
justly have been forfeited if they had not
agreed to give the evidence on which their
old commander and comrades were convicted.
What that evidence amounted to,
will be seen in due course.</p>

<p>Another hardship to which the accused
were subjected in those days was this, that
besides being deprived of the assistance of
counsel to cross-examine and comment on
the evidence, they were left in ignorance
sometimes to the last moment of the charges
to be made against them. Kidd had every
reason to believe, when brought into Court
for trial, that the only charge he had to meet
was piracy. He had been committed by
Bellamont for piracy, and examined before
the Admiralty and the House of Commons
on that charge. The great men with whom
he had been associated were supposed to
have employed him because he was a pirate.
No suggestion had been made that he had
been guilty of any other crime. And yet
when he came into Court, the first charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
against him was not that he had been a
pirate, but that he was guilty of an offence
of a totally different character, a charge of
which no notice whatever had apparently
been given him, and to meet which he had
had no opportunity of obtaining legal advice
or preparing his defence.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. He was a man of substance
in America when arrested. But in
gaol in England he was without money or
friends to prepare for his trial. Although
the Court had ordered fifty pounds to be
paid to him that he might have legal advice,
the money was not delivered to him till the
night before he was tried. What was, if
possible, unfairer than any of these things
was the deliberate withholding from him by
the officials of the papers, which the House
of Commons had ordered to be delivered to
the Admiralty for the purposes of his trial,
and in particular the two French passes, on
which he relied to prove that he had been
justified in taking the two prizes, in respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of which he was accused of piracy. No wonder
that he pleaded hard for the production
of these papers and the postponement of
his trial, until he was allowed access to them.
That there can be no question of the accuracy
of the foregoing statements, appears
clearly from the verbatim report of his trial,
perused and approved by the judges and
counsel who took part in it. Take first this
extract from that report.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> May it please your Lordships,
I desire you to permit me to have counsel.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Recorder</span> (<i>Sir Salathial Lovel</i>). What
would you have counsel for?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> My lord. I have some matter of
law, relating to the indictment, and I desire
I may have counsel to plead to it.” (He had
evidently been coached up on this point that
morning or the night before by his legal
advisers.)</p>

<p>“Dr. <span class="smcap">Oxenden</span>. What matter of law
can you have?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Clerk of Arraigns.</span> How does he know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
what he is charged with? I have not told
him.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> You must let the Court know
what these matters of law are, before you
can have counsel assigned you.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> I know what I mean. I desire to
put off my trial as long as I can, till I can
get my evidence ready.</p>

<p>“Dr. <span class="smcap">Oxenden</span>. It cannot be matter of
law to put off your trial.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> I beg your Lordships’ patience
till I can procure my papers. I had a couple
of French passes, which I must make use of
in order to my justification.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> That is not matter of law.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> I sent for them, but I could not
have them.</p>

<p>“Dr. <span class="smcap">Oxenden</span>. Where were they then?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> I brought them to my Lord
Bellamont in New England.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Mr. Kidd, the Court sees no
reason to put off your trial&mdash;you must
plead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> If your Lordship will permit
those papers to be read they will justify me.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Mr. Kidd, you must plead.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> I cannot plead till I have those
papers I have insisted upon.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Lemmon</span> (<i>one of his counsel</i>). He
ought to have his papers delivered to him,
because they are very material for his
defence. He has endeavoured to have them,
but could not get them.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Coniers</span> (<i>one of the counsel for the
prosecution</i>). You are not to appear for
any one until he pleads, and that the Court
assigns you for his counsel.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> They would only put off the
trial.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Coniers</span>. He must plead to the indictment.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> It is a hard case, when all these
things shall be kept from me, and I shall be
called on to plead.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Clerk of Arraigns.</span> Make silence.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> My papers were all seized, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
cannot make my defence without them. I
desire my trial to be put off until I can have
them.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> If he will not plead, there
must be judgment.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> My lord, I insist upon my
French passes. Pray let me have them.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> Mr. Kidd, I must tell you, if
you will not plead, you must have judgment
against you, as standing mute.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> If your Lordships permit those
passes to be read, they will justify me. If
I plead, I shall be accessory to my own
death, till I have persons to plead for me.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Recorder.</span> You are accessory to your
own death, if you do not plead.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> My lord, would you have me to
plead, and not have my vindication by me?”</p>

<p>After a long altercation, Kidd was at
length persuaded to hold up his hand in
token that he pleaded not guilty. His first
indictment was then read, of which the following
are the most material parts: “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
jurors of our sovereign Lord the King do
upon their oath present that William Kidd,
late of London, mariner, not having the fear
of God before his eyes, but being moved and
seduced by the instigation of the Devil,
against the peace of our Sovereign Lord the
King, violently, feloniously, voluntarily, and
of malice aforethought, did make an assault in
and upon one William Moore upon the high
seas near the coast of Malabar in the East
Indies, and within the jurisdiction of the
Admiralty, with a certain wooden bucket,
bound with iron hoops of the value of eight
pence, giving the said William Moore with
the bucket aforesaid upon the right part of
the head one mortal bruise, of which mortal
bruise the aforesaid William Moore did languish
and die. How sayst thou, William
Kidd, art thou guilty of this murder,
whereof thou standest indicted, or not
guilty?”</p>

<p>Poor Kidd may well have been taken
aback, as he listened to this astounding indictment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
So this was what that rascally
Clerk of Arraigns had been hinting at, when
he said he did not yet know what he was
charged with. What on earth was the meaning
of all this legal chicanery? He had been
committed by Bellamont at Boston, because
he was supposed to be a pirate, and sent over
to London to be tried, because piracy was
not a hanging offence in America. Murder
was a hanging offence in America. If he
was supposed to be a murderer, why had he
not been tried for murder there? If he was
to be tried for murder here, why had no
notice of this charge been given him, unless
it were to prevent him from preparing his
defence, and getting his evidence ready?
He had been examined at great length by
Bellamont and his Council, and by the Admiralty
and the House of Commons as to his
supposed piracy; but in neither examination
does it appear that the slightest suggestion
had been made that he was a murderer. By
whose trick was it that he was now to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
tried for murder? But although the accusation
seemed too ridiculous for any one to
bring against him, except lawyers at their
wits’ ends to find some excuse for hanging
him, it had to be met, and he met it promptly
by pleading, “Not guilty.” Then he again
proffered his request to have counsel assigned
him, naming Dr. Oldish and Mr.
Lemmon, whom he had apparently consulted
that morning or the night before,
after getting his fifty pounds. His application
was granted, but subject only to the
condition that he had to plead any matter
of law.</p>

<p>His counsel then addressed the Court,
but only on the question of the postponement
of his trial for piracy.</p>

<p>“Dr. <span class="smcap">Oldish</span>. My lord, he moves that
his trial for piracy may be put off for several
reasons. It is very fit that it should be
put off for some time, because he wants some
papers very necessary for his defence. It
is very true he is charged with piracy in several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
ships. But they had French passes,
when the seizure was made. Now if there
were French passes, it was a lawful seizure.</p>

<p>“Justice <span class="smcap">Powel</span>. Have you those
passes?</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> They were taken from me by my
Lord Bellamont, and those passes would be
my defence.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Lemmon</span>. My lord, I desire one
word as to this circumstance. He was doing
his King and country service instead of being
a pirate. For in this very ship, there
was a French pass, and it was shown to Mr.
Davies and carried to my Lord Bellamont,
and he made a seizure of it. And there was
a letter<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> writ to testify it, which was produced
before the Parliament” (apparently
neither Kidd nor his counsel were aware
that the passes themselves had been laid before
Parliament and delivered over to the
Admiralty for production at the trial), “and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
that letter has been transmitted from hand
to hand, so that we cannot at present come
by it. There are several other letters and
papers that we cannot get, and therefore we
desire the trial may be put off till we can
procure them.</p>

<p>“Lord <span class="smcap">Chief Baron Ward</span>. Where are
they?</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Lemmon</span>. We cannot yet tell
whether they are in the Admiralty, or
whether Mr. Jodrell hath them.</p>

<p>“Justice <span class="smcap">Powel</span>. Let us see on what you
go. What ship was it that had the French
passes?</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Lemmon</span>. The same we were in.
The same he is indicted for.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Solicitor General</span>. They have
had a fortnight’s notice to prepare for the
trial.</p>

<p>“Dr. <span class="smcap">Oldish</span>. We petitioned for money,
and the Court ordered fifty pounds, but the
person that received it went away, and we
had none till last night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lord <span class="smcap">Chief Baron Ward</span>. You
ought to make it out that there is a reasonable
cause to put off the trial, otherwise it
cannot be allowed. What notice have they
had?</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Solicitor General</span>. A fortnight’s
notice&mdash;this day fortnight.</p>

<p>“Dr. <span class="smcap">Oldish</span>. My lord, he should have
had his money delivered to him.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> I had no money nor friends to
prepare for my trial till last night.</p>

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Lemmon</span>. My lord, we will be
ready to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Solicitor General</span>. My lord, this
we will do. In the meantime let him be tried
for the murder, wherein there is no pretence
of want of witnesses and passes.”</p>

<p>This preposterous proposal, which in effect
was that Kidd should be tried at once
on an indictment for murder sprung upon
him a few moments before, arising out of an
incident that had occurred some three and
a half years previously, and be forced on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
spur of the moment without conferring with
any legal adviser, to conduct his own defence
with the Solicitor General and other
eminent counsel against him, seems to have
excited no comment, but to have been assented
to as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“The <span class="smcap">Clerk of Arraigns</span>. Set aside all
but Captain Kidd. William Kidd, you are
now to be tried on the bill of murder. The
jury is going to be sworn. If you have any
cause of exception you may speak to them,
as they come to the Book.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> I shall challenge none. I know
nothing to the contrary, but that they are
all honest men.”</p>

<p>The greater part of the evidence in this
trial has already been given verbatim in the
narrative of the voyage of the <i>Adventure
Galley</i>. It is clear from it that the crew for
some time before the altercation, which led
to Moore’s death, had been on the brink of
mutiny; that Moore was the spokesman of
the mutineers who were prevented by Kidd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
from seizing the Dutch ship, and that he
and his associates had concocted a plan, by
which they thought they might have seized
her and extorted documentary evidence
from the Dutchmen to excuse themselves
and Kidd in the event of their being called
in question for doing so. The balance of
evidence is strongly in favor of Moore’s
having upbraided Kidd in the altercation
which ended in the fatal blow, for not having
allowed the mutineers to have their own
way. When Kidd called him “a lousie
dog,” his answer practically was that if
Kidd had taken his advice, he and his companions,
so far from being “lousie dogs,”
would have made their fortune and been
gentlemen. Kidd seems to have knocked
him down in a moment of very justifiable
indignation, and without any intention of
killing him. It is not even clear from the
evidence that Moore died of the blow. The
only two witnesses against Kidd at the trial
were Palmer and Bradenham. On Kidd’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
behalf three of the prisoners, Owens, Parrott,
and Barlicorn, gave evidence, and Kidd
offered to call the rest of them if necessary.
When he asked Bradenham, the principal
witness against him, with a view to test the
value of his evidence, whether he had not
been in the mutiny himself, he was prevented
from insisting on an answer by the
Lord Chief Baron Ward, who said, “You
will not infer that if he was a mutineer it
was lawful for you to kill Moore.” Not
only was he prevented from eliciting this
fact, which would have tended to discredit
the chief witness against him, but he was
prevented from calling evidence as to his
own character. The Lord Chief Baron
summed up very summarily against him, being
evidently desirous of ending the case as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>“The prisoner is indicted,” said he, “for
murder. Now to make the killing of a man
to be murder, there must be malice prepense
either express or implied. The law implies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
malice, when one man without any reasonable
cause or provocation kills another. You
have had this cause opened to you. What
mutiny or discourse might be a fortnight or
month before will not be any reason for so
long continuance of passion.” (Had the
Lord Chief Baron ever been in command
himself of a mutinous crew, he might have
thought otherwise.) “But what did arise
at the time, the witnesses tell you.” (As a
matter of fact, they were far from agreeing
as to the conversation.) “The first witness”
(King’s evidence) “tells you, the first
words that were spoken were by Mr. Kidd,
and upon his answer, Mr. Kidd calls him,
‘lousie dog.’ The reply was, ‘If I am so,
you have made me so.’ Now, gentlemen, I
leave it to you to consider, whether that
could be a reasonable occasion or provocation
to take a bucket and knock the deceased
on the head and kill him. Now for the prisoner
on such a saying, and without any other
provocation to take a bucket and knock a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
man on the head and kill him must be
deemed an unjustifiable act. For, as I have
said, if one man kill another without provocation
or reasonable cause, the law presumes
and implies malice; and then such killing
will be murder in the sense of the law, as
being done of malice prepense. If there be
a sudden falling out and fighting and one is
killed in heat of blood, then the law calls it
manslaughter, but in such a case as this, that
happens on slight words, the prisoner calls
the deceased a ‘lousie dog,’ and the deceased
says, ‘If I be so, you have made me
so,’ can this be a reasonable cause to kill
him? and if you believe them not to be a reasonable
cause of provocation I cannot see
what distinction can be made, but that the
prisoner is guilty of murder. Indeed, if
there had been a mutiny at that time, then
there might have been a reasonable cause
for him to plead in his defence, and it ought
to have been taken into consideration. But
it appears that what mutiny there was, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a fortnight at least before.” (There can be
little doubt that the crew were on the brink
of mutiny for months before and months
after this occurrence.) “Therefore, gentlemen,
I must leave it to you, if you believe
the King’s witness, and one of the prisoner’s
own” (Query, and disregard the evidence
of Kidd and the others), “that this blow was
given by the prisoner in the manner aforesaid,
and are satisfied that it was done without
reasonable cause or provocation, then he
will be guilty of murder, and if you do believe
him guilty of murder on this evidence,
you must find him so, if not you must acquit
him.”</p>

<p>The jury then withdrew, and in about an
hour returned and gave in their verdict
“Guilty.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SUBSEQUENT TRIALS FOR PIRACY</span></p>

<p>On the following day Kidd and his fellow
prisoners were tried at the Old
Bailey for the piratical seizure of the
<i>Quedagh Merchant</i> and other alleged piracies
of minor importance, this trial having,
as has already been explained, been postponed
in order that Kidd might get the
papers which had been ordered by the House
of Commons to be handed over to the Admiralty
for the purposes of his trial. With
admirable brevity and lucidity his two counsel,
Dr. Oldish and Mr. Lemmon, had explained
to the Court that these papers would
constitute his defence, inasmuch as the
French passes would clearly show that his
seizure of his two prizes had been lawful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and that in taking them, so far from being
a pirate, he had done his King and country
service. Their plea that the trial should be
put off in order that these papers might be
procured had been allowed as reasonable;
and the glibber of his two counsel, Mr. Lemmon,
had apparently satisfied himself that
they would be forthcoming; for he had
ended by jauntily observing: “My lord, we
will be ready to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>What happened during the next few
hours can only be conjectured. What does
seem certain is, that when the morning came,
neither Dr. Oldish nor Mr. Lemmon appeared
on Kidd’s behalf; nor had the French
passes and other papers that had been promised,
been furnished to Kidd; that his trial
began and ended without their production;
and that not one of the judges who took
part in it, the most prominent of whom was
the Lord Chief Baron Ward, who had been
present in Court the day before, and heard
the arguments for the postponement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
trial, made any comment on the absence of
Kidd’s counsel, or asked for any explanation
from the Admiralty officials or any one
else for the non-production of the passes,
which they had been told would constitute
Kidd’s defence. Indeed, as will be seen, the
Lord Chief Baron in his summing up went
so far as to suggest that they existed only in
Kidd’s imagination.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable that the monstrous
miscarriage of justice, which ensued, was
the result of mere accident, negligence, or
stupidity. It was clearly the duty of the
officials of the Admiralty, in whose court
Kidd was being tried, to allow him access to
the papers, including the passes, which had
been delivered to them by the order of the
House of Commons for that purpose. It
was clearly the duty of Kidd’s two paid
counsel to put in an appearance and press
for a further postponement of the trial, until
these passes had been produced, instead of
leaving him, as they did, in the lurch to conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
his own defence, with the disastrous
results that might have been anticipated.
It is very difficult to avoid the suspicion of
foul play on behalf of one or more of the
great personages interested in the case. In
this connection there are certain facts which
it is impossible to ignore. At the time of the
trial, impeachments were pending in Parliament
against Orford, the late First Lord of
the Admiralty, and Somers, for their participation
in Kidd’s enterprise. No efforts had
been spared by their political opponents to
induce Kidd to make damaging disclosures
against them. Thus far they had been unsuccessful.
Kidd had remained faithful to
his employers. But dead men tell no tales;
and neither Orford nor Somers could have
felt any security against untoward disclosures
on his part so long as he remained alive.
Coming to the last of the very significant
close coincidences of date that abound in
this case, we find that Somers deferred putting
in his reply to the Articles of Impeachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
drawn up against him by the Commons
until the day after Kidd’s execution. In
order to appease public opinion and the
East India Company, some scapegoat was
indispensable, if these two great men were
to be allowed to go scot free. Can it reasonably
be doubted that it was this consideration
that induced the officials of the Admiralty
to keep back from Kidd and from the
Court the two French passes which would
have been his salvation and which had been
delivered to them by the House of Commons,
in order that he might have access to
them?</p>

<p>The report of his trial will be found melancholy
reading by those who still retain
some belief in the impartiality of the judges
and the honesty of the counsel of that age.
Three of the latter, the Solicitor General,
the advocate of the Admiralty, and their
junior Mr. Coniers, with their trained wits
and long experience in criminal cases, were
long odds for poor Kidd and his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
to contend against, although the only
evidence produced by the prosecution consisted
of the uncorroborated testimony of
two of the mutineers who had deserted their
colours at Madagascar and joined Culliford
in open piracy. These men had evidently
been carefully taken by the attorneys
through every incident in the voyage of the
<i>Adventure Galley</i>, which lent itself to ingenious
misrepresentation, tending to the
discredit of Kidd and his companions. In
some instances they obviously tried to mislead
the jury, and were only prevented
from doing so by Kidd’s simple questioning
of them. Ignorant of the rules of the court
he tried more than once to break in and give
his own version whilst they were giving
theirs. “Hear me,” he cried, springing up
in court on one occasion; but was promptly
reduced to silence by the reminder that when
the time came, he could question the witnesses.
He did ask them some very pertinent
questions, from the answers to which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
was clear that they had wilfully endeavoured
to deceive the Court. But he was, of course,
no adept in the art of systematic and persistent
cross-examination. As time went on,
and it became evident that whenever he
asked any question with the object of testing
the credibility of the two deserters, he
was stopped by the judge, and whenever
their evidence was in conflict with his statements
or those of any of his men, it was
readily believed, he not unnaturally became
impatient, and after a while gave up the
hopeless job in despair. It must not be forgotten
that he and his men were placed at
a great disadvantage by being all included
in the same indictment for piracy, and that
consequently not one of them could be called
and examined as a witness for the defence.
Kidd seems to have felt this keenly. On
being told by the Junior Counsel for the
prosecution, “Now, if you will ask this witness
any question, you may,” he replied,
“What signifies it to ask him any question?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
We have no witnesses, and what we say
signifies nothing.” At last in reply to the
Solicitor General whether he had any further
questions to ask, he replied, “No, no.
So long as he swears it, our words or oaths
cannot be taken;” and again, “It signifies
nothing to ask any questions. A couple of
rogues will swear to anything.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Solicitor General</span>. “Will you ask
any further questions?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “No, no, I will not trouble the
Court any more: for it is a folly.”</p>

<p>It might have been thought that the testimony
given by such unimpeachable witnesses
as Colonel Hewson, Captain Bond,
Captain Humphreys, and Mr. Cooper of the
character and eminent public services of
Kidd was entitled to some weight, in cases
where the question for the jury to decide
was the relative credibility of Kidd and such
of his men as had remained faithful to him,
and that of the two mutineers who had by
their own confession joined Culliford in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
open piracy, and had since been promised
their lives if they would take Kidd’s. This,
however, was clearly not the view of the
Lord Chief Baron. Speaking of Kidd in
his summing up he said: “He has called
some persons here to give an account of his
reputation, and of his services done in the
West Indies, and one of them says” (as a
matter of fact they all swore to it) “he did
good service there. Well, so he might and
might have” (<i>sic</i>) “and it is very like he
had such reputation, when the King trusted
him with these commissions, else I believe
he had never had them, so that (<i>sic</i>) whatever
he might be so many years ago, that is
not a matter to be insisted on now, but what
he hath done since, and how he hath acted in
this matter charged against him.” The
Lord Chief Baron evidently had no belief
in the doctrine “<i lang="la">Nemo repente fuit turpissimus</i>.”</p>

<p>Bradenham, before he had been caught by
the police in London, had been seen by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of Kidd’s witnesses, a Mr. Say, at the Marshalsea.
This witness, on being told by a
friend that Bradenham had been Kidd’s surgeon,
had observed: “There is a mighty noise
about Captain Kidd,” on which Bradenham
admitted that he had been with Kidd at
Madagascar, but expressed his opinion that
Kidd “had done nothing but what he could
answer for, and nothing that could do him
any hurt.” The truthfulness of this evidence
was not questioned by the prosecution:
but it was swept aside contemptuously
by the Lord Chief Baron. “Mr. Bradenham,”
he said, “was with him there. There
is no doubt of that. It is not to be questioned,
that he would not say anything ill
against him then.” In other words, Bradenham
in the judge’s opinion, was a witness
whose voluntary evidence on an ordinary
occasion was worthless. His testimony
could only become of value, when given under
compulsion, with the object of saving
his own life, and after he had been drilled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to cast it into such a shape that it would in
the opinion of the legal advisers of the
Crown, imperil the life of another man of
unimpeachable antecedents, whom the Government
desired to destroy. It is to be
feared that such views of the value of King’s
evidence were by no means rare in those
days. When questioned by the Judge, why,
if he thought the <i>Quedagh Merchant</i> was a
lawful prize, he did not have her condemned,
Kidd’s simple answer was that his men
would not allow him to do so. As a matter
of fact he was on his way to the nearest
Court of Admiralty competent to condemn
her, when his men mutinied. “My lord,” he
said, “there were ninety-five men that deserted
my ship and took away what they
pleased. We could not stand in defence of
anything.” He explained that he had nothing
to do with the sharing of the goods amongst
his men, and knew nothing of it. He was
never near them. Questioned as to his coming
to terms with Culliford, he replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
“My lord, I designed to take that frigate
and I designed to come to England, I said
let us take this ship, and did they not all
consult and say, where there is one that will
fire against the pirate there are ten that will
fire against you? And so they went and
took the goods and left me.”</p>

<p>The main question at issue was not however
whether Kidd had been justified in failing
to keep the deserters in hand, or in
coming to terms with Culliford, after they
had left him, but whether the two prizes
which he had taken had French passes on
board when captured.</p>

<p>This was fully recognised by the Lord
Chief Baron who in his summing up in the
case of the <i>Quedagh Merchant</i> said: “Now
this is the great case before you, on which
the indictment turns. The ship and goods
as you have heard, are said by the witnesses”
(<i>i. e.</i>, by the King’s evidence) “to
be the goods of Armenians and other people
that are in amity with the King: and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Kidd would have them to be the goods
of Frenchmen, or at least that the ship was
sailed under French passes. Now if it were
as Captain Kidd says, it was a lawful prize
and liable to confiscation: but if they were
goods of persons in amity with the King,
and the ship was not navigated under French
passes, it is very plain it was a piratical seizing
of them.”</p>

<p>There can be no doubt therefore that if
Kidd had been able to produce the passes
in court, he would have had a perfect defence.
Unfortunately he seems to have
been unaware that Bellamont had sent them
over to England. His case was that he had
given them to Bellamont, and he believed
that Bellamont was keeping them back. Being
unable to get them, or to have his trial
postponed until they could be obtained, he
tried as a last resource to get Bradenham and
Palmer to admit that they knew of their
existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd</span> (<i>to Bradenham</i>). “Did you not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
see any French passes aboard the <i>Quedagh
Merchant</i>?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradenham.</span> “You told me you had
French passes. I never did see them.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “Did you never declare this to
anybody that you saw the French passes?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradenham.</span> “No, I never did see any;
but I only said I heard you say you had
them.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd</span> (<i>to Palmer</i>). “I ask him whether
I had no French passes.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmer.</span> “Indeed, Captain Kidd, I cannot
say. I did hear him say he had French
passes, but I never saw them. I have heard
Captain Kidd say several times that he had
French passes.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “And did you hear nobody else
say so?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmer.</span> “No.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “It is in vain to ask any questions.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chief Baron Ward.</span> “What was
that pretence of a French pass?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmer.</span> “I saw none.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “But you have heard of it.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmer.</span> “I have heard of it, but I never
saw it.”</p>

<p>Unable to get any admissions from these
two, Kidd called another witness, Mr. Davis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “I desire Mr. Davis may be called&mdash;Mr.
Davis, pray give an account, whether
you did not see a French pass.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Davis.</span> “I came a passenger from Madagascar,
and from thence to Amboyna”
(evidently a clerical error for Anguilla)
“and there he sent his boat ashore, and there
was one said Captain Kidd was published a
pirate in England, and he gave him those
passes to read&mdash;the Captain said they were
French.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chief Baron Ward.</span> “Who gave
them?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Davis.</span> “Captain Kidd gave them.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “You heard Captain Elms say
they were French passes.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Davis.</span> “Yes. I heard Captain Elms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
say they were French passes. Says he, If
you will, I will turn them into Latin.”</p>

<p>Summing up this evidence, the Lord
Chief Baron said: “Gentlemen, it is to be
considered what evidence Captain Kidd hath
given to prove that ship and goods to belong
to the French King or his subjects, or that
the ship was sailed under a French pass, or
indeed that there ever was a French pass
shown or seen. He appeals to the witnesses
over and over again, Did you never see it?
No, say they. Nor did not you, saith he, say
you saw it. No, saith the witness. I said
that Captain Kidd said he had a French
pass, but I never saw it.”</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, this must be observed,
If this was a capture on the high sea, and
these were the goods of persons in amity
with the King and had no French pass, then
it is a plain piracy.”</p>

<p>“Now what does Captain Kidd say to all
this? He has told you he acted pursuant to
his commission: but that cannot be, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
he gives you satisfaction that the ship and
goods belonged to the French King, or his
subjects, or that the ship had a French pass.
Otherwise neither of them (<i>sic</i>) will excuse
him from being a pirate; for if he takes the
goods of friends, he is a pirate: he had no
authority for that; there is no colour from
either of his commissions to take them. And
as to the French passes there is nothing of
that appears by any proof; and for aught I
can see, none saw them but himself, if there
ever were any.”</p>

<p>Fortunately for Kidd’s memory, these
passes, as has already been stated, had been
made Parliamentary papers. Verbatim
copies of them will be found in <a href="#APPENDIX_C">Appendix C</a>.</p>

<p>The Admiralty may well look back with
pride to some of the performances of its officials,
but the shameful suppression of these
passes at Kidd’s trial is not one of them.
Had they been produced, as they ought undoubtedly
to have been in accordance with
the order of the House of Commons, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
would have puzzled even the Lord Chief
Baron to discover an excuse for directing the
jury to find Kidd and such of his crew as
had remained faithful to him guilty of
piracy.</p>

<p>Of the latter, three, Barlicorn, Jenkins,
and Lumley, apprentices to the Captain, the
Mate and the cook were acquitted by the
jury. Four others, Howe, Churchill, Mullins,
and Owens, the cook, pleaded that they
had surrendered under the King’s Proclamation,
the first three to Colonel Bass, the
Governor of East Jersey, and the fourth to
a Justice of the Peace in Southwark.
There is no question but that these men had
been misled by this proclamation into thinking
that if they surrendered as they did, they
would have a free pardon, and that but for
being so misled they would have been at
large. Three of them had been in gaol
awaiting their trial for nearly two years.
But their plea was disallowed on the ground
that they had surrendered to the wrong persons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
The proclamation was dated the eighth
of December, 1698. It had been sent out to
St. Marie’s on board of Captain Warren’s
squadron, which was conducting the ambassador
of the Great Mogul on a tour to the
Eastern seas that he might see with his own
eyes that the Government was at last making
a serious effort to suppress the Eastern
piracy. It declared the King’s intent to be
“That such as had been guilty of any acts
of piracy in the seas East of the Cape of
Good Hope, might have notice of His Most
Gracious Intention of extending His Most
Royal mercy to such of them as should surrender
themselves, and to cause the severest
punishment to be inflicted upon those who
should continue obdurate.” The King’s
intent seemed therefore plain, that he would
pardon all those who surrendered themselves.
But the proclamation “required
and commanded all persons who had been
guilty of any act of piracy in any place
eastward of the Cape of Good Hope to surrender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
themselves to the four commissioners
named in it;” and it empowered these gentlemen
only, who were traveling about with
the Great Mogul’s ambassador and were not
readily accessible, “to give assurances of the
King’s Most Gracious pardon to all such
as should surrender themselves.” The
Lord Chief Baron held that the proclamation
must be construed strictly.
“It says,” said he, “they must surrender
themselves to such and such persons by
name. See if it be not so. Here are several
qualifications mentioned. You must bring
yourselves under them, if you would have
the benefit of it.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moxon</span> (<i>counsel for one of the prisoners</i>).
“But, my lord, consider the nature
of this proclamation, and what was the design
of it, which was to induce pirates to
come in.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chief Baron Ward.</span> “If you
would have the benefit of it, you must bring
yourself under the conditions of it. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
there are four Commissioners named that
you ought to surrender to. But you have
not surrendered to any one of these, but to
Colonel Bass, and there is no such man
named in the proclamation.”</p>

<p>The consequence of this decision was that
all four of the men who had surrendered
under the proclamation were condemned
to death along with Kidd, and their comrades,
some of whom when it became clear
that they would be condemned were desirous
that their loyal obedience to their captain
should be placed on record, <i>e. g.</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gabriel Loffe</span> (<i>a foremast man from
New York</i>). “I have nothing to say, but
to ask him” (Bradenham) “whether I did
ever disobey my captain’s commands, or was
in any way mutinous on board the ship.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradenham.</span> “No. I cannot say you
did.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parrot</span> (<i>the Plymouth boy</i>). “My lord,
I desire you would ask the witnesses,
whether I ever disobeyed my captain’s commands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Mr. Palmer, did you ever see me
guilty of an ill thing? Did I ever disobey
my captain?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmer.</span> “You were always obedient to
your captain.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mullins</span> (<i>the Irishman</i>). “Mr. Bradenham,
did I do anything against my captain’s
commands?” (It is to be feared he
did, in leaving him.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bradenham.</span> “I cannot say, but that
he did always obey the Captain’s commands.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mullins</span> (<i>again, this time to Palmer</i>).
“Did not Captain Kidd often say that his
commission would bear him out in what he
did?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Palmer.</span> “Yes. I have often heard him
say that.”</p>

<p>Judge <span class="smcap">Turton</span>. “But how came you to
go aboard Culliford?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mullins.</span> “For want, my lord.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loffe</span> (<i>again</i>). “My lord, I was a servant
under Captain Kidd and always obeyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
his commands, and had no share. I came
home with Captain Kidd to Boston, and
went to my Lord Bellamont.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Howe.</span> “Have I not obeyed my captain
in all his commands?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chief Baron Ward.</span> “There is
no doubt made about that.”</p>

<p>Kidd himself on being asked whether he
had anything more to say replied, “My
lord, I had many papers for my defence if
I could have had them.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chief Baron Ward.</span> “What
papers were they?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “My French passes.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chief Baron Ward.</span> “Where are
they?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kidd.</span> “My Lord Bellamont had them.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Chief Baron Ward.</span> “If you had
anything of disability upon you to make
your defence, you should have objected it
at the beginning of your trial. What you
mean by it now, I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>In mercy to the memory of this wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
old judge, let us hope that this obtuseness
was not feigned, and that he had really forgotten,
though it is difficult to see how he
could have done so, Kidd’s impassioned entreaties
at the beginning of his trial on the
preceding day for the production of these
papers, the protracted discussion which took
place thereon in which he had himself taken
part and the undertaking that the papers
should be produced.</p>

<p>When the jury had brought in their verdict,
Kidd, asked whether he had anything to
say for himself why he should not die according
to the law, replied, “My lord, I
have nothing to say, but that I have been
sworn against by perjured and wicked people.”
After sentence had been pronounced,
he added, “My lord, it is a very hard sentence.
For my part, I am the innocentest
person of them all, only I have been sworn
against by perjured persons.”</p>

<p class="center larger">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">KIDD’S END</span></p>

<p>Kidd’s experience of the legal profession
and the procedure of our English
courts, though short, had been painfully
instructive. After his return to Newgate,
he seems to have had no more to do with
either of them. But he had yet to reckon
with his political and religious advisers, who
combined to beset him to the last.</p>

<p>Bellamont’s apologist says: “Dr. G&mdash;&mdash;g
knows who the person was, who was with
Kidd more than once some few days before
his execution and dealt so freely with him
as to advise him to charge two lords by name
with somewhat that was material, which he
said was the only way he could save his life.
And the more to provoke the poor wretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
to follow his advice, swore to him that those
lords and their friends, were restless in soliciting
to have him hanged, and therefore
it was reasonable for him to do their business.”
“God,” he adds, “disappointed all
these cursed designs. Perhaps the unhappy
creature knew himself incapable to make a
probable story, or to carry on one though
made to his hands, and that deterred him
from hearkening to these counsels of devils.
I rather hope that as wicked as he had been,
he was not arrived at such a pitch, as to
attempt to take away other men’s lives and
honour by deliberate perjuries.”</p>

<p>It never seems to have occurred to this
gentleman, or indeed to any one else, during
Kidd’s last days, that he was innocent of the
crimes laid to his charge, and that he was not
likely to go back on his word. Not only in
his statements with respect to his employers,
but also in his simple written narrative to
Bellamont and in the oral evidence given
at his trial of the various incidents in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
voyage he had told a plain unvarnished tale,
from which he had never deviated. So far
as his dealings with his employers were concerned
he had sworn in his examinations before
the Admiralty and also in the House of
Commons, that he had never seen Somers or
Shrewsbury, or heard more of them, than
that Bellamont had told him they were two
of the owners of the <i>Adventure Galley</i>; that
Bellamont had introduced him to Orford and
that Colonel Hewson had carried him to
Romney in his coach which was all that he
knew of them. He had been recalled and
pressed to make some further disclosure with
regard to these great personages, and asked
categorically if he knew anything in relation
to Bellamont, Romney, Shrewsbury,
Somers, or Orford, or any of the other
owners, in relation to his expedition, or any
other matter, touching any private directions,
articles or instructions, given to him
by word of mouth or otherwise. And after
taking time “to recollect himself well,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
had affirmed that “he had nothing more to
say in relation to the owners than that he had
before declared.” It may safely be assumed
that his answer to Dr. G&mdash;&mdash;g’s mysterious
friend, whoever he may have been, was to
the same effect.</p>

<p>It remained now for him to undergo that
last trial of his patience, to which all condemned
prisoners had in those days to submit,
the well-meant attempts on the part
of the Chaplain of the gaol to extort from
them confessions of their guilt. If Kidd
had yielded to this cruel pressure, he would
have left this world with a lie upon his lips,
as it is to be feared many poor creatures
did before and after him. Witness the confessions
of some of those convicted of
witchcraft. It is no small confirmation of
his innocence that he was able to emerge
even from this trying ordeal without discredit
to his veracity.</p>

<p>The Ordinary of Newgate at that time
was the Rev. Paul Lorrain, well known in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
his day as the author of innumerable “Last
Dying Speeches and Confessions” of noted
criminals, who seems to have combined with
the more serious duties of his calling as
confessor to the doomed the somewhat incongruous
functions discharged in these latter
days by enterprising press interviewers
of celebrities in whose personal peculiarities
and proclivities the reading public may be
supposed to take an interest. He can
rarely, if ever, have had more promising
subjects for his professional treatment, or
men of whose last days his account was
likely to have a wider circulation, than Kidd
and his fellow sufferers.</p>

<p>There are two extant records of the “Behaviour,
Confessions and Last Dying
Words of Kidd and the other Pirates that
were Executed with Him.” Both were published
by the same printer, E. Mallet at
the Hat and Hawk in Bride Lane. One of
these accounts is signed by Lorrain on the
day of the execution, and concludes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
these words: “This is all the account, which
(in this hurry) can be given of these persons
by Paul Lorrain. Friday, May the 23rd
1701.” It is clear from internal evidence
that the earlier part of this account had been
carefully composed before the day of execution,
and that it was only the concluding portion
of it which was hurriedly written on that
day. No inconsiderable part of the earlier
paragraphs is devoted to the texts and heads
of the discourses delivered by the Ordinary
to the prisoners, on the two preceding
Sundays when they had had the
privilege of listening to him. These, admirable
as they may be, it is unnecessary to
reproduce in the present narrative. From
the remainder of this account it appears that
Lorrain on the day after their trial visited
the prisoners, and “did pray with them and
admonish them to self examination and repentance,”
that during his whole attendance
on them, which was “every day, both forenoon
and afternoon” until the day of execution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
he “pressed upon them the acts of
faith and repentance, exhorting them to confess
their crimes.” “I at last,” he says,
“prevailed on them to uncover and own
those crimes which they had before so industriously
endeavoured to hide or excuse, particularly
Captain Kidd, who vainly flattering
himself with hopes of a reprieve, deferred
his confession so long that there was hardly
any time left for taking it in any exactness
or order.” (It is clear from the latter part
of his account that Kidd never confessed to
any of the crimes of which he had been convicted.)
“Darby Mullins, one of the condemned
pirates was of all the rest the most
ready and free to open himself to me: and
therefore I shall begin with his confession.”
Let us see what the free and open confession
of this poor man amounted to
and what were the heinous crimes, which he
had so industriously endeavoured to hide or
excuse.</p>

<p>“I. <i>Darby Mullins</i>, about 40 years old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
born in Ireland hard by Mullingfelt, about
16 miles from Londonderry. He said he
lived in his own country and with his parents
and followed the plough, while he was young,
but being kidnapped he was carried away
into the West Indies, where he served a
planter for the space of four years. Afterwards
he turned a waterman, and followed
several other employments in and about
Jamaica. And when the earthquake happened
there he was miraculously preserved,
yet took no great notice of his deliverance,
so as to be thankful (as he ought) to God
for it, which is now matter of trouble and
grief to him. After this earthquake he went
to Kingston, a town in these parts, and there
he built himself a house and sold liquors,
etc. Then he came to New York, with his
family in the <i>Charity</i>, Captain Sims commander,
and continued there two years. At
the end of which he took his passage on
board <i>Captain Slade</i> to the Madeiras, where
he stayed but three weeks and then returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to New York; and some time after having
bury’d his wife there, he was not able any
longer to keep house; but apply’d himself
to carrying and fetching wood from place to
place in a boat of his own, about 20 tons.
Then he left off this employment and engaged
himself with Captain Kidd and afterwards
with Captain Culliford, not knowing
but that it was very lawful (as he said he was
told) to plunder the enemies of Christianity.
But now he being shew’d that those
were the greatest enemies to Christ and his
religion, who did such unaccountable things,
as he and his companions did, contrary to
the laws of Christianity, which they profess,
he said he heartily begged pardon of God
and the world for it, and wished he had not
been such an offender. He confessed he had
been a great sinner in that he had not served
God as he should have done, but far from
that had of late very much given himself up
to swearing, cursing and profaning the Sabbath
Day, which had deservedly brought this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
calamity upon him. He seemed to be very
penitent of the facts, for which he was justly
condemned, and prayed to God to forgive
both these and the other errors and miscarriages
of his past life. He was a poor unlearned
person, not very much acquainted
with the principles of religion. Yet he
was very willing to be directed and express’d
great hopes that through the merits
of Christ he should find mercy and salvation.”</p>

<p>“II. <i>Captain William Kidd</i>, condemned
for murder and piracy. He was about 56
years of age. I found him very unwilling
to confess the crime he was convicted of, or
to declare anything, other than that he had
been a great offender, and lived without any
due consideration either of God’s mercys or
judgments, or of his wonderful works which
had so often been set before him. That he”
(like Mullins) “never remembered to have
returned Him thanks for the many great deliverances
he had received from him, or call’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
himself to account for what he had done.
But now he owns that God is a just God,
and he is a vile and wretched sinner. He
says he repents of all his sins and hopes to
be saved through the merits of Christ. He
further declares that he dies in charity with
all the world.” So far, it is clear, he had
made no confession either of murder or
piracy.</p>

<p>“On the day being the day of execution,
I went betimes to these condemned persons,
and had them up to the Chappel both morning
and afternoon, where having given them
further admonitions to Faith and Repentance,
they seemed to me very desirous and
earnestly striving to die in God’s favour.
Only I was afraid the hardness of Captain
Kidd’s heart was still unmelted. I
therefore apply’d myself with particular
exhortations to him” (‘the innocentest
person of them all,’ to quote his own
words) “and laid the judgment of God
against impenitent and hardened sinners, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
well as his tender mercies to those that were
true and sincere penitents, very plainly before
him. To all which he readily assented
and said that he truly repented of all his
sins, and forgave all the world: and I was
in good hopes that he did so. But having
left him to go a little before him to the place
of execution, I found to my unspeakable
grief, when he was brought thither, that he
was inflamed with drink,” (Some kind fellow
countryman had possibly given the poor
old man a wee drappie of which he must
have stood sorely in need, after all these exhausting
religious exercises and his confinement
for over a year in Newgate), “which
had so discompos’d his mind that it was now
in a very ill frame, and very unfit for the
great work now or never to be perform’d by
him. I prayed for him, and so did other
worthy divines that were present, to whom
as well as to myself the Captain appeared
to be much out of order, and not so concerned
or affected as he ought to have been.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
’Tis true he spoke some words expressing
his confidence in God’s mercys through
Christ, and likewise declared that he died in
Charity with all the world. But still I suspected
his sincerity” (Why?) “because he
was more reflective upon others than upon
himself” (as he might well be) “and would
still endeavour to lay his faults upon his
crew and others, going about to excuse and
justify himself much about the same manner,
as he did upon his trial. When I left
him at Newgate he told me he would make
a full confession at the tree,” (so he did,
of everything he had to confess) “but instead
of that he was unwilling (contrary to
my expectation) to own the justice of his
condemnation or so much as the providence of
God, who for his sins had deservedly brought
him to this untimely end. I continued to
pray for him and the rest, who (to outward
appearance) were very humble and penitent,
particularly Darby Mullins, who persisted
in asserting what he had told me before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and said it was the truth and he had
nothing to add to or diminish from it. This
being done and the Captain having warned
all mariners of ships and others to have a
care of themselves, and take warning from
him” (the words of his warning were very
significant as will be seen below) “I then
sang with them a Penitential Psalm, and
after another short prayer, recommending
them to God, I parted with them and left
them to the Divine Mercy. And then they
were turned off.”</p>

<p>“But here I must take notice of a remarkable
(and I hope a most lucky) accident
which then did happen,” (it may be
doubted whether the reverend gentleman
would have considered it so lucky if it had
befallen himself) “which was this, that the
rope by which Captain Kidd was ty’d broke,
and so falling to the ground he was taken
up alive, and by this means had opportunity
to consider more of that Eternity he was
launching into. When he was brought up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and ty’d again to the tree, I desired leave
to go to him again, which was granted.
Then I showed him the great mercy of God
in giving him unexpectedly this further respite,
that so he might improve the few moments
left now so mercifully allowed him in
perfecting his Faith and Repentance. Now
I found him in much better temper than before.
But as I was unwilling, and the station
also very incommodious and improper
for me to offer anything to him by way of
question, that might have perhaps discomposed
his spirit, so I contented myself to
press him to embrace (before it was too
late) the Mercy of God now again offered
him upon the easy conditions of Stedfast
Faith, True Repentance and Perfect Charity,
which now he did so fully and freely express,
that I hope he was hearty and sincere
in it, declaring openly that he repented with
all his heart, and dy’d in Christian Love and
Charity with all the world” (as he had repeatedly
said before). “This he said, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
was on the top of the ladder (the scaffold
being now broken down) and myself halfway
on it, as close to him as I could, who
having for the last time prayed with him,
left him with a greater satisfaction than I had
before, that he was penitent.”</p>

<p>From the later account above referred to
which purports to be “The only True Account
of the Dying Speeches of the Condemned
Pirates,” and is possibly a revised
edition of the earlier account by Paul Lorrain,
we learn that “all the prisoners were
conveyed from Newgate to the execution
dock in Wapping by the officers of the Admiralty
and others, carrying the Silver Oar
before them according to the usual custom:”
that Kidd’s “behaviour in Newgate after
condemnation was not so serious and devout
as became a person under his circumstances,
but whether it proceeded from an heroick
temper in not seeming to be in any way terrified
or afraid on the approaches of death
(tho’ in a violent manner) he being naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of an undaunted mind and resolution,
or from a conceited hope of obtaining a reprieve,
there being great endeavours tho’ in
vain used for that purpose, is yet unknown.”</p>

<p>The author of this account also informs
us that Kidd “could hardly be brought to a
charitable reconciliation with those persons,
who were evidences against him alleging
that they deposed many things that were inconsistent
with truth and that much of their
evidence was by hearsay: and in the general
part of his discourse seemed not only to reflect
on them <em>but on several others, who instead
of being his friends as they professed,
had traitorously been instrumental in his
ruin</em>!” “He further declared that as to
the death of William Moore, his gunner,
the blow that he gave him, it was in a passion,
as being provoked by him to do so, but not
with an intention of any manifest injury,
much less to kill or murder him. Nay, he
was so far from bearing any malice against
him, that he freely gave £200 for his ransom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and further said that all his sailors
knew he always had a great love and respect
for him; adding that if any one concerned
in his tryal had acted contrary to the dictates
of his or their own conscience he heartily
forgave them, and desired that God
would do the like.” “He expressed abundance
of sorrow for leaving his wife and
children without having the opportunity of
taking leave of them, they being inhabitants
in New York. So that the thoughts
of his wife’s sorrow at the sad tidings of his
shameful death was more occasion of grief
to him than that of his own sad misfortunes.”
“<em>He desired all seamen in general,
more especially Captains in particular to
take warning by his dismal unhappiness
and shameful death and that they would
avoid the means and occasions that brought
him thereto, and also that they would act
with more caution and prudence, both in
their private and public affairs by sea and
land, adding that this was a very fickle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
faithless generation.</em>” (He had undoubtedly
found it so.) “After he had ended his discourse
to the people, he spent the rest of
his time in Prayer and other pious and
Godly exercises with the Ordinary of Newgate
and other ministers: and at last seemed
very devout and penitent, expressing his
hearty sorrow for his manifest transgressions,
especially the unhappy and sudden
death of William Moore his gunner&mdash;but
would not call it murder to the very last,
esteeming it rather an accidental misfortune
than a murder by reason that there was but
one blow given and that in passion without
any premeditated malice.”</p>

<p>No reference is made in this account to
Kidd’s being “inflamed with drink.” It is
clear from it that whether or not he had
been given a drop of whiskey on his way to
execution, he was to the end in the full possession
of his faculties.</p>

<p>The only member of his crew who was
hung with him was poor Darby Mullins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the remainder being at the last moment reprieved.
Why Mullins, who had surrendered
himself to the Governor of East
Jersey along with two others, relying on
the King’s proclamation, was selected as
Kidd’s fellow-sufferer, is not clear. It is
true that he was an Irishman, and in the
opinion of the chaplain in a better frame of
mind to meet his death than any of his companions:
but neither of these circumstances
in itself seems quite a satisfactory justification
for hanging him. He had no doubt
joined Culliford, unquestionably by far the
most guilty of all the seamen implicated,
but for whose presence at Madagascar,
when the <i>Adventure Galley</i> arrived there,
Kidd in all probability would have been able
to bring his prizes home before the hue and
cry had been raised against him. But Culliford,
though indicted for several piracies
about the same time as Kidd, apparently
escaped scot free, having been clever enough
to save his neck by surrendering to the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
persons under the King’s proclamation, and
to secure the services of a counsel who did
not fail to put in an appearance on his behalf,
when his case came on for hearing;
the result of which was that “his case” (according
to a note in the State Trials) “being
particular and argued by Counsel he
was respited.”</p>

<p>To come now to the last painful incident
in this disgraceful tragedy. The day after
Kidd’s corpse had been hung aloft in chains
on the gallows, Somers dared at last to
break the silence he had so long maintained
and to put in his reply to the Articles of
Impeachment brought against him by the
Commons. The allegations he had to meet
were that in the grant of the goods of the
pirates to the co-adventurers, the name of
Samuel Newton, one of the Grantees, had
been “used in trust and for the sole benefit
of” himself: that “the grant manifestly
tended to the obstruction of trade and navigation,
the great loss and prejudice of merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and others, His Majesty’s subjects,
and the dishonour of the King and his Kingdom:”
and that “by procuring and passing
it,” he had been guilty of a notorious breach
of his duty. In his reply he was forced to
admit that Newton had been named in the
grant, “by and in trust for him,” and was
apparently unable to give any excuse whatever
for this discreditable deception. He
pleaded that the grant “did not in any way
tend to the obstruction or discouragement of
trade or navigation, or to the loss or prejudice
of His Majesty’s subjects, nor to the
dishonour of His Majesty or His Kingdom.”
He denied (and the denial implied
what would be considered in these days
a very low estimate of official honesty) that
the passing of the grant was any breach of
duty, inasmuch as it “was formed as a
recompense to the grantees, who at their
own charge had provided and fitted out the
said Ship” (the <i>Adventure Galley</i>) to enable
Kidd “to execute the powers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
said grant mentioned, <em>whereby the public
might have received great benefit had the
said William Kidd faithfully discharged the
trust reposed in him by His Majesty and
the Grantees, which he failing to do, the
owners of the said ship had lost their expenses,
and had not received any benefit
from the grant</em>.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it may well be
doubted whether any of the grantees, excepting
Kidd and Livingstone, lost any part
of their expenses. As has already been
shown, one of the conditions on which their
legal advisers had been careful to insist had
been that if the prize moneys were insufficient
to make good the full amount advanced
by the grantees, other than Kidd and
Livingstone, the deficiency was to be made
good by Kidd and Livingstone, both of
them men of substance. We have seen with
what eagerness, and with what disastrous
results to Kidd, Livingstone had endeavoured
to get his bond restored to him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Bellamont. That Kidd’s estate of itself,
notwithstanding the fact that he was unable
in Newgate to get funds for his defence
until the night before his trial, was sufficient
to have covered any loss sustained by
the great men, who had exploited him, is
clear from the fact that of his effects forfeited
to the Crown, six thousand four hundred
and seventy-one pounds were afterwards
given by Queen Anne towards the
establishment of Greenwich hospital.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> But
whether or not these great men found it inconvenient
to reclaim their one thousand
pounds apiece, it is impossible to doubt that
when making this cruelly unjust charge of
faithlessness against Kidd the day after his
death, Somers was fully acquainted with
the essential facts of the case. It is incredible
that he had not read Kidd’s narrative,
the depositions of his men, and Bellamont’s
correspondence, and that he was not cognizant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of all the proceedings at Kidd’s trial,
the keeping back of the French passes by
the Admiralty officials: the failure of Kidd’s
counsel to put in an appearance on the
critical day when he was tried for piracy;
the break-down of the most material parts
of the King’s evidence; and the manner in
which the trials had been conducted throughout
by the Lord Chief Baron. It is to be
feared that he not only knew all this, but
that his was the unseen master hand that
had held the strings, which had been so skilfully
and ruthlessly manipulated as to bring
about Kidd’s death so opportunely by the
verdicts of London juries. If this be so,
what is to be said of the Whig historians,
who have dealt with Kidd’s case? Is it possible
to believe in the face of indisputably
recorded facts, that Somers really was the
immaculate politician of his day depicted
for us by Macaulay, “whose integrity,” we
have been assured, “was ever certain to
come forth bright and pure from the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
severe investigation”? In the foregoing
pages an attempt has been made, it is believed
for the first time, to allow the personages
who took part in this melancholy
business to speak for themselves, so far as
the extant records permit. Hitherto by a
conspiracy of silence, their voices have been
hushed, and the facts of the case studiously
suppressed or perverted by eminent advocates,
who have thought it necessary, if the
memories of Somers and his colleagues were
to be cleansed from the stigma which clung
to them in their own day from the part
they took in it, that Kidd’s reputation
should be blackened, and that he should be
depicted as a villain of the deepest dye,
whom, on account of his unexceptionable
antecedents, these great men were fully justified
in employing, but whose character underwent
so rapid a deterioration after he
had once come into contact with them, that
he betrayed them for the purpose of enriching
himself with spoils, of which as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
matter of fact he stood in little need and
which he made no effort to secure for himself.
He has been represented by Macaulay
not only as a rapacious pirate, but also as
a monster of cruelty, who for his own ends
depraved his crew and led them into every
kind of wickedness. To quote but one passage
from Macaulay’s indefensible and inexcusable
travesty, “With the rapacity he had
the cruelty of his odious calling. He burnt
houses: he massacred peasantry. His prisoners
were tied up and beaten with naked
cutlasses, in order to obtain information
about their concealed hoards. One of his
crew, whom he had called a dog, was provoked
into exclaiming in an agony of remorse,
‘Yes, I am a dog: but it is you that
have made me so.’ Kidd in a fury struck
the man dead.”</p>

<p>These accusations have obtained ready
credence; but their absurdity will be evident
to any one who will take the pains to
examine the records. There is no reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
whatever for believing that Kidd was cruel
or rapacious. The only ground for suggesting
that “he massacred peasantry” is the
one case, when his cooper’s throat having
been cut by the natives, he retaliated by
ordering one native to be shot. This was
the only time when it was ever alleged in
his own day that he had burnt houses: and
we have it on the authority of Palmer, the
King’s evidence against him, that on this
occasion Kidd had given express orders to
his men to spare the houses that had white
flags hoisted on them, because their inmates
had helped to water his ship. The episode
on the strength of which Macaulay accuses
him of causing his prisoners to be beaten with
cutlasses, in order to extort from them information
as to their concealed hoards, has
already been explained. The men in question
were not his prisoners. He allowed
them to proceed peacefully on their voyage,
and their ship was not taken from them.
Kidd never went on board of her, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
less did he give directions to his crew to ill-use
them. Questioned as to whether any
gold had been taken from them, Palmer
freely admitted that he did not see any.
Asked further by Kidd, whether it was not
the case that a parcel of rogues had gone
on board and done the deed complained
of, he virtually admitted that it was so by
making no reply. In the matter of cruelty
there is a marked difference between the
reported doings of Kidd and of the pirates
of whom the East India Company were
repeatedly complaining. In these complaints
mention is often made of the outrages
committed: but in the case of Kidd
the Company made no complaint of similar
misdeeds. From all that can be learned
of him, he seems to have been a kind-hearted
man. There is no reason to doubt the truth
of his dying statement that he had paid two
hundred pounds for his gunner Moore’s
ransom, probably on the occasion when the
natives had cut his cooper’s throat. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the reasons which led Bellamont to employ
him is stated by Bellamont’s apologist to
have been Kidd’s well-known affection for
his wife and family, which was also relied on
by Bellamont as being strong enough to prevent
him from attempting to escape by forsaking
them on his return. And we have it
on the record of a witness who certainly had
no bias in his favour that his chief solicitude
in Newgate after he had been sentenced to
death was for them and not for himself.</p>

<p>The suggestion that Moore, when knocked
on the head by Kidd, was “in an agony of
remorse” for acts of piracy which Kidd had
led him to commit, is almost too ludicrous
to call for comment. It is absolutely clear
from the evidence of every witness of the
occurrence that so far from Kidd having led
Moore astray, Moore had vainly endeavoured
to induce Kidd to become a pirate,
and that it was his failure to succeed in this
endeavour that led to the altercation which
ended in his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>But the most flagrant fiction fabricated
by a Whig historian in relation to poor
Kidd, is not to be found in Macaulay’s
history, but in the pages of a grave
historical work, compiled by an eminent
lawyer, who in his day had filled not only
the office of Lord Chief Justice, but also
that of Lord Chancellor. That great legal
luminary, Lord Campbell, in his “Life of
Somers” has not hesitated to insert a circumstantial
fable to the effect that Kidd was
caught red-handed on the high seas in the
midst of his criminal career. In the fifth
volume of his “Lives of the Chancellors,”
pages 126 and 127, he tells the tale thus:
“A noble vessel called the <i>Adventure Galley</i>
was fitted out, and the command of her
given to William Kidd, a naval officer, esteemed
for honour as well as for gallantry.
On arriving in the Indian Seas, he turned
pirate himself, and cruised against the commerce
of all nations indiscriminately, till
after a sharp engagement with an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
frigate in which several fell on both sides,
he was captured and brought home in irons.”
To such depths can history sink when written
by political partisans of the highest rank
and respectability.</p>

<h3>1. A Copy of a Narrative of the Voyage
of Captain William Kidd, Commander
of the “Adventure Galley,”
from London to the East
Indies.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Boston</span>, 17th July, 1699. Mr. John
Gardner of Gardner’s Island presented this
note to His Excellency in Council, which he
made oath was delivered to him by Captain
Kidd, as was wrote with the said Kidd’s
own hand on board his sloop, and all the
particulars therein mentioned were committed
to his custody.</p>

<p>Examined by Isa Addington Secretary.</p>

<p>That the Journal of the said Captain
<i>Kidd</i>, being violently taken from him in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Port of St. Marie’s in Madagascar, and his
Life being many times threatened to be
taken away from him by Ninety-Seven of
his Men that deserted him there, he cannot
give that exact Account he otherwise could
have done: but as far as his Memory will
serve, is as followeth, viz.,</p>

<p>That the said <i>Adventure Galley</i> was
launched in <i>Castle’s</i> Yard at <i>Deptford</i>,
about the Fourth of <i>December</i> 1695; and
about the latter end of <i>February</i> the said
Galley came to the <i>Buoy in the Nore</i>:
and about the 1st Day of <i>March</i> following,
his Men were pressed for him for the Fleet;
which caused him to stay there for Nineteen
Days; and then sailed for the <i>Donnes</i>, and
arrived there about the Eighth or the Tenth
Day of <i>April</i> 1696; and sailed thence for
<i>Plymouth</i>; and on the Twenty-third Day of
the said month of <i>April</i> he sailed on his intended
Voyage: and, some time in the month
of <i>May</i>, met with a small French Vessel,
with Salt and Fishing Tackle on board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
bound for <i>Newfoundland</i>, which he took and
made Prize of, and carried the same into
<i>New York</i>, about the Fourth Day of <i>July</i>,
when she was condemned as lawful Prize:
The Produce whereof purchased provisions
for the said Galley, and for her further intended
Voyage.</p>

<p>That about the Sixth Day of <i>September</i>
1696, the said Captain Kidd sailed for the
<i>Maderas</i>, in company with one Joyner,
Master of a Brigantine belonging to <i>Bermudas</i>,
and arrived there about the 8th Day
of <i>October</i> following: and thence to <i>Bonavista</i>,
where they arrived about the nineteenth
of the said month, and took in some
Salt, and stayed Three or Four Days; and
sailed thence to <i>St. Jago</i>, and arrived there
the Twenty-fourth of the said Month, where
he took in some Water, and stayed about
Eight or Nine Days; and thence sailed for
the <i>Cape of Good Hope</i>; and in the Latitude
of Thirty-two, on the Twelfth Day of
<i>December</i> 1696, met with Four English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Men of War: Captain <i>Warren</i> was Commodore;
and sailed a week in their Company;
and then parted, and sailed to Telere,
a Port in the <i>Island of Madagascar</i>, and being
there about the Twenty-ninth Day of
January, came in a Sloop belonging to <i>Barbadoes</i>,
loaded with Rum, Sugar, Powder
and Shot, one <i>French</i> Master, and Mr.
<i>Hatton</i> and Mr. <i>John Batt</i>, Merchants; and
the said Hatton came on board the said Galley,
and was suddenly taken ill and died in
the Cabin: And, about the latter end of
<i>February</i>, sailed for the <i>Island of Johanna</i>,
the said Sloop keeping Company, and arrived
there about the Eighteenth Day of
<i>March</i>; where he found Four East India
Merchantsmen outward bound; and watered
there all together, and staid about Four
Days: And from thence, about the Twenty-second
of <i>March</i>, sailed for <i>Mehila</i>, an
Island Ten Leagues distant from <i>Johanna</i>,
where he arrived the next Morning,
and there careened the said Galley;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
and about Fifty men died there in a Week’s
Time.</p>

<p>That on the 25th Day of <i>April</i> 1697, set
sail for the Coast of India, and came upon
the Coast of <i>Mallabar</i>, the Beginning of the
Ninth of <i>September</i>; and went into <i>Carwarr</i>
upon that Coast about the middle of the
same Month, and watered there: And the
Gentlemen of the English factory gave the
Narrator an account, That the <i>Portuguese</i>
were fitting out Two Men of War to take
him; and advised him to put out to Sea,
and to take Care of himself from them, and
immediately to set sail thereupon; …
about the 12th of the said month of <i>September</i>;
and the next morning, about Break of
Day saw the said Two Men of War standing
for the said Galley; and spoke with him and
asked him, Whence he was? Who replied
from <i>London</i>; and they returned answer,
From <i>Goa</i>; and so parted, wishing each
other a good Voyage; And making still
along the Coast, the Commodore of the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Man of War kept dogging the said Galley
all the Night, waiting an Opportunity to
board her; and in the Morning, without
speaking a Word, Fired Six great Guns at
the Galley, some whereof went through her,
and wounded Four of his Men; and thereupon
he fired upon him again; and the Fight
continued all Day; and the narrator had
Eleven Men wounded: the other <i>Portuguese</i>
man of War lay some Distance off, and
could not come up with the Galley, being
calm; else would have likewise assaulted the
same; the said Fight was sharp, and the said
<i>Portuguese</i> left the said Galley with such
Satisfaction, that the Narrator believes no
<i>Portuguese</i> will ever attack the King’s Colours
again, in that Part of the World especially.
And afterwards continued upon
the same Coast, cruising upon the coast of
<i>Cameroone</i>, for Pirates that frequent that
Coast, till the Beginning of the month of
<i>November</i> 1697, When he met with Captain
<i>How</i> in the <i>Loyal</i> Captaine, an <i>English</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Ship belonging to <i>Maderas</i>, bound to <i>Surratt</i>,
whom he examined; and finding his
Pass good, designed to freely to let her pass
about her Affairs; but, having Two <i>Dutchmen</i>
on board, they told the Narrator’s Men,
That they had divers <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Armenians</i>
on board, who had divers precious
Stones and divers other rich Goods on
board, which caused his Men to be very mutinous,
and got up their Arms, and swore
they would take the Ship: and two-thirds of
his Men voted for the same: The narrator
told them, the small Arms belonged to the
Galley, and that he was not come to take
any <i>Englishmen</i>, or lawful Traders; and
that if they attempted any such thing, they
should never come on board the Galley
again, nor have the Boat, or small Arms; for
he had no Commission to take any but the
King’s Enemies, and Pirates, and that he
would attack them with the Galley, and
drive them into <i>Bombay</i>; the other being a
Merchantman, and having no Guns, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
easily have done it with a few Hands; and,
with all the Arguments and Menaces he
could use, could scarce restrain them from
their unlawful Design; but at last I prevailed,
and with much ado I got him clear,
and let him go about his Business. All which
the said Captain <i>How</i> will attest, if living.</p>

<p>And that, about the 18th or 19th Day of
the said month of <i>November</i>, met with a
<i>Moors</i> Ship of about 200 Tons coming from
<i>Surratt</i>, bound to the Coast of <i>Mallabar</i>,
loaded with Two Horses, Sugar and Cotton,
to trade there having about Forty <i>Moors</i> on
board, with a <i>Dutch</i> Pilot, Boatswain, and
Gunner; which said Ship the Narrator
haled, and commanded on board; and with
him came Eight or Nine <i>Moors</i>, and the said
Three <i>Dutchmen</i>, who declared it was a
<i>Moors</i> Ship; and demanding their pass from
<i>Surrat</i>, which they shewed; and the same
was a <i>French</i> Pass, which he believes was
shewn by a Mistake; for the Pilot swore
Sacrament she was a Prize, and staid on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
board the Galley; and would not return on
board the Moor Ship; but went in the Galley
to the Port of <i>St. Marie</i>.</p>

<p>And that, about the First Day of <i>February</i>
following, upon the same Coast, under
<i>French</i> Colours with a Design to decoy, met
with a Bengall Merchantman belonging to
<i>Surratt</i>, of the Burden of 4 or 500 Tons,
10 Guns; and he commanded the Master on
board; and a <i>Frenchman</i>, Inhabitant of
<i>Surratt</i>, and belonging to the <i>French</i> Factory
there, and Gunner of the said Ship,
came on board as Master; and when he
came on board, the Narrator caused the
<i>English</i> Colours to be hoisted; and the said
Master was surprised, and said, You are
all <i>English</i>; and asking, which was the
Captain? Whom when he saw, said, Here
is a good Prize, and delivered him the
<i>French</i> Pass.</p>

<p>And that, with the said Two Prizes, sailed
for the Port of <i>St. Marie’s</i> in <i>Madagascar</i>;
and, sailing thither, the said Galley was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
leaky, that they feared she would have sunk
every Hour, and it required Eight men
every Two Glasses to keep her free; and was
forced to woold her round with Cables to
keep her together; and with much ado carried
her into the said Port of <i>St. Marie’s</i>,
where she arrived about the First of <i>April</i>,
1698: And about the 6th day of <i>May</i>, the
lesser Prize was haled into the careening
Island or Key, the other not being arrived;
and ransacked and sunk by the mutinous
men; who threatened the Narrator, and the
men that would not join with them to burn
and sink the other, that they might not go
home and tell the news.</p>

<p>And that, when he arrived in the said
Port, there was a Pirate Ship, called the
<i>Moca</i> Frigate, at an Anchor, <i>Robert Culliford</i>,
Commander thereof; who with his
Men, left the same at his coming in, and ran
into the Woods: and the Narrator proposed
to his Men to take the same, having sufficient
Power and Authority so to do; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
the Mutinous Crew told him, If he offered
the same, they would rather fire Two Guns
into him, than one into the other; and thereupon
Ninety-seven deserted, and went into
the <i>Moca</i> Frigate, and sent into the Woods
for the said Pirates, and brought the said
<i>Culliford</i>, and his Men, on board again; and
all the time she staid in the said Port, which
was the Space of Four or Five Days, the
said Deserters, sometimes in great Numbers,
came on board the said Galley and <i>Adventure
Prize</i>, and carried away great Guns,
Powder, Shot, small Arms, Sails, Anchors,
Cables, Surgeons, Chests, and what else they
pleased; and threatened several times to
murder the Narrator, as he was informed,
and advised to take care of himself; which
they designed in the Night to effect; but was
prevented by him locking himself in his
Cabin at Night, and securing himself with
barricading the same with Bales of Goods;
and, having about Forty small Arms, besides
Pistols, ready charged, kept them out;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Their Wickedness was so great, after they
had plundered and ransacked sufficiently,
went Four Miles off to one <i>Edward
Welche’s</i> House, where his the Narrator’s
Chest was lodged, and broke it open; and
took out Ten Ounces of Gold, 40 Pound of
Plate, 370 Pieces of Eight, the Narrator’s
Journal, and a great many Papers that belonged
to him, and the People of <i>New York</i>
that fitted them out.</p>

<p>That about the 15th <i>June</i>, the <i>Moca</i> Frigate
went away, being manned with about 130
Men, and Forty Guns, bound out to take all
Nations: Then it was that the Narrator was
left with only Thirteen men; so that the
<i>Moors</i> he had to pump and keep the <i>Adventure
Galley</i> above Water, being carried away,
she sunk in the Harbour; and the Narrator,
with the said Thirteen men, went on board
the <i>Adventure Prize</i>; where he was forced
to stay Five Months for a Fair Wind; In
the meantime, some Passengers presented,
that were bound for these Parts; which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
took on board, to help to bring the said <i>Adventure
Prize</i> home.</p>

<p>That, about the beginning of <i>April</i>, 1699,
the Narrator arrived at <i>Anguilla</i> in the <i>West
Indies</i>, and sent his Boat on Shore; where
his Men had the News That he and his People
were proclaimed Pirates, which put them
into such Consternation, That they sought all
Opportunity to run the Ship on Shore upon
some Reef or Shoal, fearing the Narrator
should carry them into some <i>English</i> Port.</p>

<p>From <i>Anguilla</i> they came to <i>St.
Thomas’</i>; where his Brother-in-law <i>Samuel
Bradley</i> was put on shore, being sick; and
Five more went away, and deserted him:
Where he heard the same News, That the
Narrator, and his Company, were proclaimed
Pirates, which incensed the People
more and more.</p>

<p>From <i>St. Thomas</i> set sail for <i>Moona</i>, an
Island between <i>Hispaniola</i> and <i>Porto Rico</i>;
where they met with a Sloop called the <i>St.
Anthony</i>, bound for <i>Antega</i> from <i>Curaso</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Mr. Wm. <i>Boulton</i> Merchant, and <i>Samuel
Wood</i>, Master: The men on board then
swore, they would bring the Ship no further.
The Narrator then sent the said Sloop <i>St.
Anthony</i> for <i>Curaso</i>, for Canvas to make
Sails for the Prize, she not being able to
proceed; and she returned in Ten Days; and
after the Canvas came, he could not persuade
the Men to carry her for <i>New England</i>;
but Six of them went and carried their
Chests and Things on board of Two <i>Dutch</i>
Sloops; bound for <i>Curaso</i>; and would not so
much as heel the Vessel, or do anything, the
Remainder of the men not being able to
bring the <i>Adventure</i> Prize to <i>Boston</i>, the
Narrator secured her in a good Harbour in
some Part of <i>Hispaniola</i> and left in the
Possession of Mr. <i>Henry Boulton</i> of <i>Antegua</i>,
Merchant, the Maker, Three of the
old Men, and Fifteen or Sixteen of the men
that belonged to the said Sloop <i>St. Anthony</i>,
and a Brigantine belonging to one Mr. <i>Burt</i>
of <i>Curaso</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>That the Narrator bought the said Sloop
<i>St. Anthony</i> of Mr. <i>Boulton</i>, for the
Owner’s Account; and after, he had given
Directions to the said <i>Boulton</i> to be careful
of the said Ship and Lading, and persuaded
him to stay Three Months till he returned;
and then made the best of his Way to <i>New
York</i>; where he heard the Earl of <i>Bellamont</i>
was, who was principally concerned in the
<i>Adventure Galley</i>; and hearing his Lordship
was at <i>Boston</i>, came thither; and has
now been 45 Days from the said Ship.</p>

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Boston.</span> 7th July, 1699.</p>

<p>Further the Narrator saith, That the said
Ship was left at <i>St. Katharina</i>, on the South
East Part of <i>Hispaniola</i>, about Three
Leagues to Leeward of the Westerly End
of <i>Savona</i>: Whilst he lay at <i>Hispaniola</i>, he
traded with Mr. <i>Henry Boulton</i> of <i>Antegua</i>,
and Mr. <i>Wm. Burt</i> of <i>Curaso</i>, Merchants,
to the Value of 11,200 Pieces of Eight;
whereof he received the Sloop <i>Antonio</i> at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
3000 Pieces of Eight, and 4200 Pieces of
Eight by Bills of Exchange, drawn by
<i>Boulton</i> and <i>Burt</i> upon Messieurs <i>Gabriel</i>
and <i>Lemont</i>, Merchants in <i>Curaso</i>, made
payable to Mr. <i>Burt</i>, who went himself to
<i>Curaso</i>; and the Value of 4,000 Pieces of
Eight more in Dust and Bar Gold; which
Gold, with some more traded for at Madagascar,
being Fifty Pounds Weight, or upwards,
in Quantity, the Narrator left in Custody
of Mr. <i>Gardner</i> of <i>Gardner’s Island</i>,
near the Eastern End of <i>Long Island</i>, fearing
to bring it about by Sea: It is made up in
a Bag put into a little Box, locked, nailed,
corded about, and sealed: Saith he took no
Receipt for it of Mr. <i>Gardner</i>.</p>

<p>The Gold that was seized at Mr. <i>Campbell’s</i>,
the Narrator, traded for at <i>Madagascar</i>,
with what came out of Galley.</p>

<p>Saith, That he carried in the <i>Adventure
Galley</i>, from <i>New York</i>, 154 Men: Seventy
whereof came out of <i>England</i> with him.
Some of his Sloop’s Company put Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Bales of Goods on shore at <i>Gardner’s Island</i>,
being their own proper Goods. The
Narrator delivered a Chest of Goods, viz.,
Muslins, Latches, Romalls, and flowered
Silk, unto Mr. <i>Gardner</i> of <i>Gardner’s Island</i>
aforesaid, to be kept there for the narrator:
Put no Goods on shore anywhere else:
Several of his Company landed their Chests,
and other Goods, at several Places.</p>

<p>Further saith, He delivered a small Bale
of coarse Calicoes unto a Sloop Man of
<i>Rhode Island</i>, that he had employed there.
The Gold seized at Mr. <i>Campbell’s</i> the Narrator
intended for Presents to some, that he
expected to do him Kindnesses. Some of
his Company put their Chests and Bales on
board a <i>New York</i> Sloop lying at <i>Gardner’s
Island</i>.</p>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Examination of William Jinkins,
Richard Barlycorne and Robert
Lumley</span></h3>

<p>The Examination of <i>William Jinkins</i>, of
Bow, near <i>London</i>, aged about 18 years.
Apprentice to <i>Geo. Bullen</i>, deceased, late
chief Mate to the <i>Adventure Galley</i>, Captain
<i>Wm. Kidd</i>, Commander:</p>

<p>Who saith, That, some time after <i>Christmas</i>
in the Year 1695, he sailed with the
said <i>Adventure Galley</i> from <i>Plymouth</i>, in
<i>England</i>; and the said Galley made her
Course for <i>New York</i>; took a <i>French</i> Prize
in her way, which was carried in with the
same.</p>

<p>That the said Galley, some time after her
arrival at <i>New York</i> sailed from thence to
<i>Madera</i>; from <i>Madera</i> to <i>Bonavista</i> and
<i>St. Jago</i>, where they took in Provisions, and
steered for the <i>Cape de Bon Esperance</i>, but
put not in there; but proceeded for an Island
named <i>Joanna</i>; staid there about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
Week, took on board some Water, and then
went from thence to Mohilla; where the said
Galley was laid on shore and cleaned; and
then returned again to the said Island of
<i>Joanna</i>; from whence the said Galley sailed
to <i>Motta</i> in the <i>Red Sea</i>, and there watered;
and then proceeded to a Place called <i>Bobs
Key</i>, to wait for Shipping: And, during the
time of their being there, the <i>Moca</i> Fleet
passed by; but the said Galley did not endeavour
to come up or speak with any of
them, apprehending they were too strong;
afterwards we spoke with a small Bark coming
from the <i>Red Sea</i>, commanded by one
<i>Parker</i>, out of which the Company belonging
to the said Galley took about a Bushel of
Pepper: Then the said Galley went into a
Port called <i>Callacut</i>, where was an <i>English</i>
Factory; remained there Four or Five Days,
and then went a cruising upon that Coast;
and sometime afterwards gave Chace to a
Ship about 150 Tons Burden, and, after
about Nine Hours Chace, came up with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
same; then Captain <i>Kidd</i> ordered Two Shot
to be fired at the same, to bring her to;
whereupon she accordingly brought to; and
the Master, being a <i>Dutchman</i> called <i>Skipper
John</i> came on board: There was belonging
to the said Ship Three <i>Dutchmen</i>, a
Boy, and the rest <i>Moors</i>, between Twenty
and Thirty in Number; the <i>Dutchmen</i>, and
Two or Three <i>Moors</i>, were kept on board
the said Galley, and the rest of the said
<i>Moors</i> had the Long-boat given to them to
go on shore, being then about Two Leagues
distant from the same: the said Ship was
loaded with Cotton, and had two Horses
likewise on board the same; which Cotton
and Horses Captain <i>Kidd</i> and his Company
sold to the Natives of the Country for
Money and Gold; kept the said Ship with
them, the Galley being leaky, and carried
her to <i>Madagascar</i>; When the said Galley
came up with the said Ship, the said Galley
had aboard <i>French</i> Colours, and the Master
of the said Ship brought on board a <i>French</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Pass, having other Passes besides: The Time
when the said Ship was taken, as above mentioned,
was about 13 or 14 Months since,
about a Month or Five Weeks after which,
the said Galley gave Chace to another Ship;
and, having chaced her about Four Hours,
came up with the same, the said Galley having
aboard <i>French</i> Colours, and the other
Ship <i>Armenian</i>; which Ship was of the Burden
of about 400 Tons, called the <i>Quedah
Merchant</i>, and was commanded by one
<i>Wright</i>, an <i>Englishman</i>, had on board the
same, Two <i>Dutchmen</i>, who were Mates of
the said Ship; and a <i>Frenchman</i>, who was a
Gunner, Six or Eight <i>Armenians</i>; and the
rest of the Company Moors, being about
ninety in Number; all of which Captain <i>Kidd</i>
sent on shore in the Boats that came off from
thence: the said Ship came from <i>Bengall</i>,
bound for <i>Surratt</i>; was mounted with 16 or
18 guns; the <i>French</i> Gunner of which
brought on board a <i>French</i> Pass, and said,
She was a good Prize to the <i>English</i>: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
said Captain was loaded with Bale Goods,
Sugar, Iron and Saltpetre: Captain <i>Wright</i>
who commanded the said Ship, declared she
was in the employment of the <i>English</i>; that
the Lading belonged to them: And, about
Four or Five Days after the said Ship was
taken by the said Galley, Captain <i>Kidd</i>
called the Company together, and proposed
to them to return the said Ship to those from
whom they had taken her, or sell her to
them; and said, He would agree to anything
they should do therein, were it for the Value
of a Piece of Eight: Said also to his Company,
The Taking of the said Ship would
make a great Noise in England, and they
should not know what to do with the Goods
taken in the same: But the Company of the
Galley agreed not to the said Captain
Kidd’s Proposal; but carried the said Ship
into <i>St. Marie’s</i>, off <i>Madagascar</i>, and there
unloaded her, and shared; Whereupon each
of the said Galley’s Company, being then
about 115 in Number, shared, one with another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Three Bales and some loose Goods, besides
about Two Thirds of a Bale: and Captain
<i>Kidd</i> had Forty Shares: The Bales contained
Calicoes, Romalls, Muslins, some
Silks, some striped, some flowered, and some
Plain. After sharing of the said Goods,
Ninety and upwards, of the Company belonging
to the said Galley, deserted the
same, and went to the <i>Mocha</i> Frigate, then
lying at <i>St. Marie’s</i> aforesaid: And the said
Captain <i>Kidd</i>, with the Men that remained
with him, carried their Shares on board the
Prize Ship, called the <i>Quidah Merchant</i>,
and ran the said Galley on shore, being
very leaky; and having stript her of her
Furniture, set her on Fire to get her Iron-work;
and put all that they could save,
of, or belonging to the said Galley, on
board the said Prize Ship; with which
the said Captain <i>Kidd</i>, and the men that
remained with him, and some others that
he had procured there, came from <i>St.
Marie’s</i> aforesaid, and arrived in some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
afterwards at the Island of Anguilla, in
the West Indies: Where being informed
that the said <i>Kidd</i>, and his Company, were
proclaimed Pirates, the said Captain <i>Kidd</i>,
and the men on board with him, went with
the said Ship to the Island of <i>St. Thomas</i>;
but the Governor of the said Island would
not allow the said Ship to come in there:
Whereupon we sailed to <i>Mona</i>; and there
met with one Mr. <i>Bolton</i>, of <i>Antegoa</i>, Merchant;
of whom Captain <i>Kidd</i> bought the
Sloop <i>Antonio</i>, in which he lately came to
<i>Boston</i>; gave, as this Examinant was informed
3000 Pieces of Eight for the same,
and took from out of the Prize Ship, into the
said Sloop, Forty Bales of the Goods on
board the said Ship, and about Thirty Bales
of Sugar; and left the said Ship at <i>Hispaniola</i>,
about Six or Seven Weeks since in the
Custody of the said Mr. <i>Boulton</i>, and 12
Men more: And the said Captain <i>Kidd</i>
promised to return again to the said Ship,
in the Space of Three Months; and the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
<i>Boulton</i> promised to stay with the same for
so long time; Which Ship the said Captain
<i>Kidd</i> left lying in the River, in <i>Hispaniola</i>
aforesaid, to be reckoned about Eighteen
Leagues from <i>Mona</i>.</p>

<p>The Examinant further saith, That, after
the said Galley had taken the Two Ships
before-mentioned, She also, in her Passage
to <i>St. Marie’s</i> aforesaid, took a Bark or
Ship, of the Burden of 180 Tons, with about
Seventy Persons on board, navigated with
<i>Portuguez</i>: She came from <i>Bengall</i>; and
was bound to <i>Goa</i>; and had on board Bengalls,
Muslins, Calicoes, and other things,
which the Galley’s Company began to plunder,
and bring on board the Galley; but
seeing several Ships coming down towards
them, the said Galley, with the other two
Prizes she had taken, came to sail, and left
the said last Prize at a Place between <i>Brin
John</i> and <i>Angingo</i>, so called being an <i>English</i>
and <i>Dutch</i> Factory, and left on board
the same all the Company belonging thereto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
except the Master, Merchant, and Seven
Men more, that came on board the Galley
when she first took the said Ship: And the
Vessel that was first taken by the said Galley,
as before-mentioned, was, by the said
Galley’s Company, sunk at <i>St. Marie’s</i>
aforesaid, after they had brought her
thither.</p>

<p>And the said <i>William Jinkins</i> the Examinant
further saith, That whilst Captain <i>Kidd</i>
and his Company, lay with the said Ship
<i>Quidah Merchant</i> at <i>Mona</i> aforesaid, one
<i>Burt</i>, Merchant of <i>Curaso</i>, came to them in
a Brigantine, and purchased several Goods
of the said Captain <i>Kidd</i>; for which he paid
Part in money, and Part in Flour.</p>

<p>Further saith, That the first Place that
the Sloop <i>Antonio</i> aforesaid touched at,
after the said Captain <i>Kidd</i>, and his Company,
left the said Ship at <i>Mona</i> aforesaid,
was the <i>Horekills</i> in <i>Dellaware Bay</i>, where
the said Sloop staid Two Days: and one
<i>James Gillam</i>, a Passenger that came with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
the said <i>Kidd</i> from <i>Madagascar</i>, being one
of the <i>Mocha’s</i> Frigate’s Crew, sent his
Chest on shore there, being a large chest and
heavy; which the Examinant supposeth to be
full of <i>India</i> Goods, and was stowed in the
said Sloop’s Hold in the Passage from
<i>Mona</i>: After the said Sloop had staid at the
<i>Horekills</i> aforesaid about Two Days, she
sailed to <i>Gardner’s Island</i>, and anchored
there; where Captain <i>Kidd</i> sent on shore
Two Bales of Goods, Two Negro Boys, and
a Negro Girl, and delivered them to Mr.
<i>Gardner</i>; and were not brought on board
the Sloop again, the Examinant remaining
on board almost all the time; neither was
anything more carried on shore, there, to
this Examinant’s knowledge: And there
was, in Company with the said Sloop under
Captain <i>Kidd’s</i> command, a Sloop said to
belong to <i>New York</i>, whereon one <i>Hardrick</i>,
a <i>Dutchman</i>, a young Man, was either
Skipper, or one of the Company; into which
Sloop there was put Two or more Bales,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
One of them being Bengall Silks, all belonging
to one <i>Humphry Clay</i>, and Four or
more Chests belonging to said <i>Humph
Clay</i>, <i>English Smith</i>, <i>Gabriel Luffe</i>, and
<i>Martin Skinke</i>: This Examinant was informed,
the said Sloop was bound on a trading
Voyage to <i>Martha’s Vineard</i>, with
Rum and Fruckin Cloth; but, having received
the said Bales and Chests on board,
did not proceed to <i>Martha’s Vineard</i>, but
went back again for <i>New York</i>. The said
Captain <i>Kidd</i> and his Company, then proceeded
with his Sloop to <i>Block Island</i>: and
put nothing on shore there, only Two Guns
about Two or Three hundred Weight
apiece, which Captain <i>Kidd</i> gave to one
<i>Sands</i>: Then the Sloop went to <i>Tarpolin
Cove</i>, where One or more Bales of the Captain’s
were put on shore, and delivered to
the Man that dwells there.</p>

<p>And the Examinant saith, That nothing
that was put on shore at any of the Places
aforesaid, was, to his Knowledge, received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
on board the said Sloop again: and that
nothing was put on shore at any other Place,
than what is before-mentioned.</p>

<p>The Examinant further saith, That Captain
<i>Kidd</i> traded with Mr. <i>Boulton</i> and
Mr. <i>Burt</i> aforesaid, for the Quantity of
Twenty Bales of Goods or thereabouts, as
he supposes; besides what those of his Company
with them: Six of which, viz., <i>Michael
Callaway</i>, <i>John Hales</i>, <i>John Beovender</i>,
<i>Wm. Boyer</i>, <i>Neece</i>, a <i>Dutchman</i> and
<i>Nouter</i>, a <i>Dutchman</i>, went to <i>Caracao</i> in
Burt’s Brigantine, and one other, named
<i>John Ware</i>, went thither also in a small
sloop.</p>

aged about Eighteen Years, Apprentice to
Captain Wm. Kidd,</p>

<p>He saith, That the same is true, as to the
Substance thereof.</p>

<p>And further saith, That <i>James Gillam</i>
carried Two Chests on shore at the Horekills,
which were stowed in the Hold of the
Sloop: After they came from the Horekills,
they stopt at <i>Gardner’s Island</i>; and went
from thence to <i>Oyster Bay</i>; there took in
Mr. Emott of <i>New York</i>; and set him on
shore at <i>Rhode Island</i>; in some Days afterwards,
Mr. Emot returned to the Sloop
again, as she lay off <i>Rhode Island</i>; then they
went to <i>Gardner’s Island</i>; who went from
thence, in a Whale Boat, over to <i>Long Island</i>:
And at <i>Gardner’s Island</i>, Captain
<i>Kidd</i> sent on shore there, Two Bales of
Goods, a Box, and Two Negro Boys, and a
Girl, committed to the Charge of Mr. Gardner.
The Examinant also sent Two Bales
of his own, and his Chest, on shore there; and
<i>Dick the Black</i>, another Bale: and one <i>Robert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
Avery</i>, a Passenger that came with them
from <i>Madagascar</i>, went on shore there, and
carried some Bundles of Muslin, Silks, and
other Goods of his own; and a Box about
Three Foot long, and a Foot deep: Knows
not what was in it; It was handed over the
Sloop’s Side. There was also a Sloop of
<i>New York</i>, lying at <i>Gardner’s Island</i>, into
which there was put about the Quantity of
15 or 16 Bales of Goods, Whole or in Pieces;
and about 9 or 10 Chests; Which Goods and
Chests belonged to <i>Humphry Clay</i>, <i>Gabriel
Luffe</i>, <i>Samuel Wood</i>, Captain <i>Davis</i> a
Passenger, <i>Martin Skinke</i>, <i>John Arris</i>, and
<i>English Smith</i>: The Sloop was full. From
<i>Gardner’s Island</i> we sailed to <i>Block Island</i>,
and there took in Captain <i>Kidd’s</i> Wife, and
one Mr. <i>Clark</i> of <i>New York</i>; and then stood
towards <i>Gardner’s Island</i> again, and met a
<i>New York</i> Sloop, bound home, and put Mr.
Clark on board of her: And Captain <i>Kidd</i>
put a Chest on board said Sloop: He knows
not what was in it: <i>John Arris</i> put another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
chest on board: and <i>Wm. Jinkins</i>, a Bale of
Goods; and some other Bundles, that were
made out of the Bales, were also put on
board said Sloop; and all, as aforesaid, committed
unto the said Mr. <i>Clark</i>: The Captain’s
Chest was hoisted out of the Hold.
They stopt at <i>Tarpolin Cove</i>; and there put
on shore One Bale, Two Barrels, and a Box
of Goods, delivered unto the Man that dwells
there: And, as they came over to <i>Nantinket
Shoals</i>, they met a Sloop from the Bay, commanded
by one Captain <i>Way</i>; which said
Way came on board our Sloop; and, when
he went off again;&mdash;in his canoe, by Captain
<i>Kidd’s</i> order, Two or Three small arms,
a Pendulum Clock bought of Captain
<i>Wright</i>, Commander of the <i>Quidah Merchant</i>;
a Pair of Stilliards, and a Bag
about as big as the Crown of his Hat,
sealed up; which the Examinant supposes
to be Money.</p>

<p>Further the Examinant saith, That, when
they came from <i>Hispaniola</i>, Captain <i>Kidd</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
told Mr. <i>Boulton</i>, whom he left in Charge of
the Ship that he would return to him again
in a short time, after he had spoken with my
Lord <i>Bellamont</i>; and that the <i>New York</i>
Sloop, whereinto they put the Goods at
<i>Gardner’s Island</i> as aforesaid, was an open
Sloop, manned with Two Men, named <i>Coster</i>
and <i>Hendrick</i>: There was Three Bales
of Goods, and Two Bags of Sugar, delivered
out of the Sloop <i>Antonio</i> at Boston, unto
Mr. <i>Duncan Campbell</i>. Saith, He knows
not what sum Captain <i>Kidd</i> paid for the
Purchase of the Sloop.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Boston.</span> 10th July, 1699.</p>

<p>Who saith, That, at the Island of <i>Joanna</i>,
he left the Vessel he then belonged to, and
entered himself on board the <i>Adventure Galley</i>,
Captain <i>William Kid</i>, Commander;
and from thence we sailed to the <i>Red Sea</i>,
and there cruised for Privateers and Pirates;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
but finding none, went upon the
Coast of India, and in our Cruize there, espied
a Ship, which we gave chace to, and
came up with, being a Ship of near 200 Ton
Burden, whereof a <i>Dutchman</i>, <i>Mich Dicker</i>,
the <i>Sound</i>: From <i>Gardner’s Island</i> they
was Master, being commanded on board the
Galley, brought a <i>French</i> Pass, and as the
Examinant was informed, declared, That
his Ship and Lading was lawful Prize; and
accordingly was made Prize of by the said
<i>Kidd</i> and Company: The <i>Dutch</i> Master remained
in the Galley with the other Two
Dutchmen, and took up Arms to serve under
Captain <i>Kidd</i>; the <i>Moors</i> were set on
shore, being then not above Two Leagues
from the same: The Examinant knows not
what the Ship was laden with; only saw
Two Horses sent on shore from her. And
in about Six Weeks time afterward, they
took another Ship of 400 Tons, or upwards,
mounted with about 12 or 14 Guns, commanded
by one Captain <i>Wright</i>, an <i>Englishman</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and there was also on board Two
or Three <i>Dutchmen</i>; the rest of the Company
were <i>Armenians</i> and <i>Moors</i> to the
Number of about Sixty or Seventy: The
Ship came from <i>Bengall</i>, bound to <i>Persia</i>,
as it was said; and that she belonged wholly
to the <i>Moors</i>: She was laden with Bale-Goods,
containing Muslins, Silk striped and
plain, and raw Silk, refined Sugar in Bags,
Saltpetre, Iron in Junks, Guns and Anchors:
Captain <i>Wright</i> and other the
<i>Christians</i>, with several of the <i>Armenians</i>
and <i>Moors</i>, were speedily sent on shore;
some of them came to <i>Madagascar</i> in the
Galley, and there left her: Said, Captain
<i>Kidd</i> carried the said Prize Ship into <i>Madagascar</i>,
<i>Geo. Bullen</i>, Chief Mate of the Galley,
being put into command the said Prize
Ship; and when she arrived at <i>Madagascar</i>,
they took out of her all the Bale Goods, and
shared them among the Galley’s Company,
being about One hundred in Number more
or less; some had Three, others Four Bales<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to a Share; the Examinant has Four for his
Share, which he sold at <i>Hispaniola</i>, to Mr.
<i>Boulton</i> and Mr. <i>Burt</i>, for 400 Pieces of
Eight, which was paid him down in Money;
200 Pieces of which he lost by Gaming, on
board the Sloop <i>Antonio</i>, that he came from
<i>Hispaniola</i> in; the rest of his money was
stolen from him. They arrived in the said
Sloop, first, at the <i>Horekills</i> in <i>Delaware
Bay</i>, where they put out Two Chests, belonging
to <i>James Gillam</i>, a Passenger, who
also went on shore there; which Chests, the
Examinant believes, were full of <i>India</i>
Goods; From the <i>Morekills</i> they went to
<i>Oyster Bay</i> on <i>Long Island</i>; and there took
in Mr. <i>Emot</i> of <i>New York</i>, and carried him
to <i>Rhode Island</i>, and sent him on shore
there; Then went, with their said Sloop to
<i>Block Island</i>, and put on shore Two Guns,
delivered to Two Men that came from the
Shore, and cruised between <i>Block Island</i>
and <i>Rhode Island</i> until Mr. <i>Emott’s</i> Return;
and having taken him on board went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to <i>Gardner’s Island</i>, and there let him on
shore: And there was landed at the said Island,
from out of the Sloop <i>Antonio</i>, some
Goods and Chests; and also several Bales
and Chests were put into another Sloop that
lay at the said <i>Gardner’s Island</i> bound up
sailed, with the Sloop <i>Antonio</i> to <i>Block Island</i>;
and there took up the Captain’s Wife,
and a Gentleman that accompanied her; and
then stood to <i>Gardner’s Island</i>; and there
put the said Gentleman, which, the Examinant
thinks, was named <i>Clark</i>, into a Sloop
bound up the <i>Sound</i>: into which Sloop, there
was also several Bales and Chests put, out
of the Sloop, <i>Antonio</i>, by Order of the said
Captain <i>Kidd</i>: And then we came to <i>Tarpolin
Cove</i>, where there was a Bale and one
or two Barrels of Goods landed: And from
thence we came over the Shoals, and there
met a Sloop from <i>Campechea</i>, bound to <i>Boston</i>;
the Master of which Sloop, in the
Canoe belonging to her, came on board our
Sloop; and at his going off there was put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
into the Canoe a <i>Turkey</i> work Carpet, Two
or Three Small Arms; which is all that the
Examinant took notice of.</p>

<p>The Examinant further saith, That at
their sharing at <i>Madagascar</i>, Captain <i>Kidd</i>
struck for, and received several Shares;
knows not how many; there might be Forty.
They stript the Galley at <i>Madagascar</i>, and
burnt her to save her Iron-work; and also
sunk their lesser Prize there. About Ninety
of the said Galley’s Company deserted at
<i>Madagascar</i>. The greater Prize was called
the <i>Quedah Merchant</i>; which they left in
<i>Hispaniola</i>, under the care of Mr. <i>Boulton</i>,
and about Seventeen or Eighteen men to
assist: Captain <i>Kidd</i> promising to return to
him in a short time: The Examinant supposes
there might be about 150 Bales of
Goods remaining on board her, about
Eighty or Ninety Tons of Sugar, the Saltpetre,
Iron, Guns and Anchors. Captain
<i>Kidd</i> traded with Messieurs <i>Boulton</i> and
<i>Burt</i>, for a considerable Quantity of Goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
taken out of the said <i>Quidah Merchant</i>, at
and about <i>Hispaniola</i>.</p>

<h3>4. <span class="smcap">A Copy of the Examination of Gabriel
Loff, of Long Island, within
the Province of New York, Seaman</span>,</h3>

<p>Who saith, That, in <i>September</i> 1696, he
entered himself on board the <i>Adventure
Galley</i>, Captain <i>Kidd</i> Commander, as a
Foremast-man, at <i>New York</i>; and proceeded
in the Galley from thence, first to
<i>Madera</i>, then to <i>Bonavista</i>, <i>St. Jago</i>, and
from thence to <i>Joanna</i>; and from <i>Joanna</i>
made their Course to the <i>Red Sea</i> to cruise
for Pirates; and, after some time spent
there, meeting with no Purchase, sailed for
the Coast of <i>India</i>, and cruised there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
there gave chace to a Ship, which shewed
us <i>French</i> Colours, and <i>Moorish</i> Colours,
and some others; and after some Chace,
came up with her: Captain <i>Kidd</i> commanded
the Commander of her to come on
board; who accordingly did: The Examinant
knows not what Nation he was of; but
he brought a <i>French</i> Pass, and told Captain
<i>Kidd</i>, That his Ship was a Prize and Captain
<i>Kidd</i> made Prize of her, and her Lading:
She was about 150 Tons in Burden,
laden with Cotton Wool, Bees Wax, Tobacco
and Two Horses: The company were
chiefly <i>Moors</i>;&mdash;only Three <i>Christians</i>;&mdash;he
knows not the Number; the <i>Christians</i>
remained in the Galley, and took up Arms
there; The <i>Moors</i> were sent on shore. Soon
after the Taking of this Ship, the Examinant
was taken sick, and lay so most of the
Voyage: Knows not what they did with the
Lading: The Ship they carried to <i>Madagascar</i>;
and there sunk her. Some weeks after
the Taking of the said Ship, they took another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Ship, at the Coast of <i>India</i>, of Burden
of 400 Tons, or upwards, commanded by one
<i>Wright</i>, an <i>Englishman</i>; which Ship came
from <i>Bengall</i>: The Ship was chiefly manned
with <i>Moors</i> and <i>Armenians</i>: There was
Three <i>Christians</i> on board.</p>

<p>The Examinant further saith, They carried
the said Ship and Lading with them
to <i>Madagascar</i>; and there landed all the
Bale-goods on board, consisting of Callicoes,
Muslins, Silk, and White, striped and plain,
Romalls, Bengalls, and Laches: There fell
betwixt Three and Four Bales to a Share:
The Examinant had Three whole Bales and
a Piece of a Bale, to his Share: some of
which he disposed of at <i>Madagascar</i>, to buy
Provisions; and left some in the Ship; the
Remainder he had in his own Chest, and
some in <i>Martin Skinke’s</i> Chest; which Chests
were put on board a <i>New York</i> Sloop in
the Sound, commanded by one <i>Coster</i>, and
committed to his Care, to be carried to <i>New
York</i>: Captain <i>Kidd</i> had Forty odd Shares<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
for himself, and his Ship; most of his men
deserted. At <i>St. Marie’s</i>, a difference arose
between the Captain and his Company;
Captain <i>Kidd</i> proposing to them to take
the <i>Mocha Frigate</i>, which lay there; but the
generality of the men refused, saying, They
would sooner shoot him than into the said
<i>Mocha</i> Frigate: And they went aboard the
said Frigate.</p>

<p>Further the Examinant saith, That the
aforesaid Ship, commanded by Captain
<i>Wright</i>, and taken by Captain <i>Kidd</i> in the
Seas of <i>India</i>, was called the <i>Quiddah Merchant</i>:
And that the said <i>Kidd</i>, and his
Company that remained with him, bought
the said Ship from <i>Madagascar</i> into <i>Hispaniola</i>,
in the <i>West Indies</i>; and there the said
Captain <i>Kidd</i> traded with Two Persons,
named <i>Boulton</i> and <i>Burt</i>, for some of the
Bale-goods, which were delivered out of the
Ship: And Captain <i>Kidd</i> bought a Sloop of
the said Mr. <i>Boulton</i>, and laded the said
Sloop with Bale-goods taken out of the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Ship for so much as he could conveniently
stow, and lodge the men besides: The Number
of Bales he knows not: And, leaving the
said <i>Boulton</i>, with Seventeen or Eighteen
men, on board the Ship, the said Captain
<i>Kidd</i>, with several of his Company, proceeded
in the said Sloop towards <i>New York</i>;
and the Discourse was, That Captain <i>Kid</i>
was to return to the Ship again within the
Space of Three Months: And, after their
Departure from <i>Hispaniola</i> they arrived,
with the said Sloop, first at <i>Horekills</i> in
<i>Delaware Bay</i>, where they landed a Chest
belonging to one <i>James Gillam</i>, a Passenger
with them from <i>Madagascar</i>: Knows not
what was in it: And from the <i>Horekills</i> they
sailed with the said Sloop into the Sound,
and put some Goods on shore at <i>Gardner’s
Island</i>; the Quantity the Examinant knows
not: Also put some Goods and Chests on
board the <i>New York</i> Sloop, one <i>Coster</i>,
Master, then lying at said <i>Gardner’s Island</i>:
And also put a Pack of Goods on shore at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
<i>Tarpolin Cove</i>. Whilst they lay with the
said Sloop off <i>Rhode Island</i>, <i>James Gillam</i>,
before-named, went on shore in a Boat, that
came on board the same Sloop; Knows not
from whence the said Boat came, nor who
she belonged to.</p>

of the “Adventure Galley,” Captain
Wm. Kidd, Commander; and
Samuel Arris, Mariner, late Steward
of the same Ship, of full Age;
Depose and testify, as followeth,
viz.</span>,</h3>

<p>That the said Ship was launched at <i>Deptford</i>
at <i>Castle’s</i> Yard, about the 4th Day of
<i>December</i>, 1695: And that the said Ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
came to the <i>Buoy</i> and <i>Nore</i> about the latter
End of <i>February</i>; and about the First
Day of <i>March</i> the men were pressed from
on board the said Galley for the Fleet; and
she was staid about Nineteen Days, and
there sailed for the <i>Dounes</i>; and, about the
Eighth or Tenth Day of <i>April</i> arrived there;
and thence sailed for <i>Plimouth</i>; and, on the
25th Day of the Month of <i>April</i> 1696, the
said Ship sailed from <i>Plymouth</i>; and, sometime
in the Month of <i>May</i>, met with a small
French Vessel, bound for <i>Newfoundland</i>,
which they took, and made Prize of, and
carried the same into <i>New York</i> about the
4th Day of July following; and the same
was condemned there as lawful Prize: And
that, about the 6th Day of <i>September</i> then
also following, the said Galley sailed for the
<i>Maderas</i>; and thence to <i>Bonavista</i>; thence to
<i>St. Jago</i>; thence to <i>Telere</i>, and the <i>Island of
Madagascar</i>; thence to <i>Johanna</i>, thence to
<i>Mehila</i>, where they buried about Fifty of
their Men in the Month of <i>May</i> 1697; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
thence sailed upon the Coast of <i>India</i>; and,
returning back to <i>St. Marie’s</i> the Ship was
all along so leaky, that they feared she would
have sunk every Hour; and that it required
Eight Men every Two Glasses, to keep her
free; and were forced to woold her round
with Cables, to keep her together; and, with
much ado, kept her above Water, and carried
her into the said <i>Port of St. Marie’s</i>.</p>

<p>And that they took Two Vessels, which
they carried into the said Port; and the Men,
which afterwards deserted the Galley, sunk
one of them there; and threatened the Captain,
and these Deponents, and others, now
arrived here, to sink the other, that they
might not go thence to tell News: And that
about Ninety of the said Galley’s Crew deserted
the same there; and that the said
Galley proved so insufficient and leaky, that
she possibly could not be repaired; and sunk
at an Anchor in the same Port.</p>

<p>And these Deponents further testify,
That there was in the said Port a Pirate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
called the <i>Mocha</i> Frigate: And the said Captain
<i>Kidd</i> proposed to his Men to take the
same, having sufficient Power so to do; but
the said Deserters, then being on board, told
the said Captain <i>Kidd</i>, That, if he offered
the same, they would fire Two Guns
into him, rather than One into the Other; and
immediately deserted the said Galley, and
went on board the <i>Mocha</i> Frigate.</p>

<p>And these Deponents also further Depose,
That with what Guns, Powder, and Sails,
the said Captain <i>Kidd</i> could save out of the
said Galley from the Violence of the said
Deserters, he purchased, at least, between
Thirty and Forty Bales of Goods, which he
has brought in the Sloop <i>St. Antonio</i> into
this Port, for the Use of the Owners of the
said Galley.</p>

said Sloop <i>St. Antonio</i> were purchased, as
aforesaid, for the Use of the Owners of the
said Galley.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hugh Parratt.</span></p>

<p>The Five Deponents within-named, did
severally declare, That, whereas, in their
within written Affidavits, they speak of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Taking of Two Vessels, they do further explain
themselves; and testify, That the said
Two Vessels were <i>Moorish</i> Ships, and taken
by them upon the coast of <i>India</i>: One of
them of Burden betwixt Four and Five
Hundred Tons, the other about Two Hundred
Tons; They surrendered to them without
firing any Gunns at them: The greater
Ship came from <i>Bengall</i>; the lesser Ship
came from <i>Surratt</i>: The smaller Ship was
taken in <i>November</i> 1697; the greater Ship
in <i>February</i> following: The Master, Gunner
and Boatswain of the smaller Ship were
Dutchmen, the rest of the Company were
<i>Moors</i>, being about Forty in Number in the
Whole: Her Lading consisted of some <i>Persian</i>
Silks and other Dry Goods with some
Horses. The Three <i>Dutchmen</i> afterwards
took up Arms on board the Galley: The
greater of the Two Ships is the same that
they lately left at <i>Hispaniola</i>: She had
about Ninety men on board: She was commanded
by an <i>Englishman</i> named <i>Wright</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
The Mate and Gunner were <i>Dutch</i>; all the
rest of the Company were <i>Moors</i>: She was
mounted with Ten Guns; and laden with
<i>Bengall</i> Goods.</p>

<p>The Deponents further say, They met
with the <i>Mocha Frigate</i> at the <i>Port of St.
Marie’s</i>; and the Company belonging to her
took the Companies belonging to the aforesaid
Two Ships, forcibly, from on board the
<i>Adventure Galley</i>; and Ninety of the Company
of the said Galley there also left her,
and entered themselves on board the said
<i>Mocha Frigate</i>; having first plundered the
Two Ships before-named, and taken out of
them a considerable Quantity of Goods and
disposed of them at their pleasure.</p>

<p>I, the said <i>Duncan Campbell</i>, being at

Company with Mr. <i>James Emott</i> of <i>New

besides: after hailing of which Sloop, and being
informed, That the said <i>Kidd</i> was Commander

or 600 Tons from <i>Madagascar</i>, which some
considerable time since he met within … and
commanded her there to bring to; and
that thereupon the Pilot, being a <i>Frenchman</i>,
came on board the said <i>Kid’s</i> Ship,
and told him, the said <i>Kidd</i>, He was welcome,
and that the said Ship, to which the
said Pilot belonged, was a lawful Prize to
him, the said <i>Kidd</i>, she sailing under a
French pass, whereupon he, the said <i>Kid</i>,
and Company, took the said Ship; and afterwards,
understanding that the same belonged
to the Moors, he, the said <i>Kid</i>,
would have delivered her up again; but his
Men violently fell upon him and thrust him
into his Cabin, saying, The said ship was a
said Prize (sic); and then carried her into
<i>Madagascar</i>, and rifled her of what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
pleased: But before they got into <i>Madagascar</i>,
the Galley under Command of him, the
said <i>Kidd</i>, became so leaky, that she would
scarce keep above Water; whereupon the
Company belonging thereto, having taken
out her Guns, and some other Things, and
put them on board the Prize, set the said
Galley on Fire.</p>

<p>The said Captain <i>Kidd</i> further told me,
That, when he and his Company were arrived
at <i>Madagascar</i> several of his Company
moved him to go and take a Ship called the
<i>Moca</i> Frigate, that lay ready fitted at a
Place not far distant from them, in the Possession
of certain Privateers; and to go in
the same for the <i>Red Sea</i>; but that he the
said <i>Kid</i> said, That if they would join with
him, he would attempt the Taking of the
said Ship, supposing her a lawful Prize, being
formerly belonging to the King of <i>England</i>;
but would not afterwards go with
them on the said Design to the <i>Red Sea</i>:
Whereupon Ninety of his, the said <i>Kidd’s</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Men, deserted him, went and took the said
Ship, and sailed with the same on the said
Design, as he, the said <i>Kid</i>, was informed;
obliging one Captain <i>Culliver</i>, the then Commander
of her, to go along with them.</p>

<p>And the said <i>Kidd</i> further told me, That
his Men having left him, and his Design
frustrated, he thought it his best Way to
preserve the said Ship then in his Possession,
and the Goods on board her, for his
Employers, or the proper Owners thereof;
And accordingly, with the few Men he had
then left, which would not join with the
other Ninety in their aforesaid Design, being
about Twenty in Number, and with a
few other men, that he procured at <i>Madagascar</i>,
to assist him in navigating the said
Ship, he intended to have brought the same
to <i>Boston</i>, according to his Orders; but,
touching in his Way at the Island of <i>St.
Thomas</i>, and other Places in the <i>West Indies</i>,
he there heard, That great Complaints
were preferred against him, and he proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
a Pirate; which occasioned him to
sail to a Place called <i>Mona</i>, near <i>Hispaniola</i>:
from whence he sent to <i>Curaso</i>, and
brought there the Sloop on which he is now
on board, and took into her to the Value of
about 8 or 10,000<i>l</i> in Goods, Gold, and
Plate: for which Gold and Plate he traded
at <i>Madagascar</i>, and was produced by the
Sale of sundry Goods and Stores, that he
took out of the <i>Adventure Galley</i>, formerly
commanded by him; and hath left the Ship
taken by his Company, and carried to <i>Madagascar</i>,
as aforesaid, at or near <i>Mona</i>
abovesaid, in the Custody of about Six Men
of his own Company, and Eighteen others
that he got from <i>Curaso</i>; the Merchant of
whom he bought the said Sloop, being intrusted
therewith; unto which he had promised
to return again in Three Months; the
said <i>Kidd</i> resolving to come into <i>Boston</i> or
<i>New York</i>, to deliver up unto, your Excellency
what Goods and Treasure he hath on
board; and to pray your Excellency’s Assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
to enable him to bring the said Ship
left by him at <i>Mona</i> aforesaid, from thence;
the said Ship being disabled from coming for
want of Furniture.</p>

<p>But the said Captain <i>Kidd</i> further informed
me, That by reason of what his Men
had heard in the <i>West Indies</i>, as aforesaid,
of their being proclaimed Pirates, they
would not consent to his coming into any
Port without some Assurance from your
Excellency, That they should not be imprisoned
nor molested: And the said Captain
<i>Kidd</i> did several times protest solemnly,
That he had not done anything since his going
out in the said Galley contrary to his
Commission or Orders, more than what he
was necessitated unto, being overpowered by
his Men that deserted him, as aforesaid; who
evil-intreated him several times for his not
consenting to, or joining with them in, their
Actions: And all the men on board the
Sloop now with him did, in like manner,
solemnly protest their Innocence; and declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
That they had used their utmost Endeavours
in preserving the aforesaid Ship
and Goods for the Owners or Employers.</p>

<p>The said <i>Kidd</i> also saith, That, if your
Lordship should see Cause so to direct, he
would carry the said Ship for <i>England</i>,
there to render an Account of his Proceedings.</p>

<p>Which beforegoing contains the Particulars
of what Captain <i>Kidd</i> and his Men related
to</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
